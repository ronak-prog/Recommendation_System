The current second wave of AI is termed statistical AI. The deep learning techniques have been able to exploit large amounts of data and massive computational power to improve upon human levels of performance in narrowly defined tasks. Separately, knowledge graphs emerged as a powerful tool to capture and exploit an extensive amount and variety of explicit knowledge to make algorithms better understand the content, and enable the next generation of data processing, such as in semantic search. Now, we herald towards the third wave of AI built on what is termed as the neuro-symbolic approach that combines the strengths of statistical and symbolic AI. Combining the respective powers and benefits of using knowledge graphs and deep learning is particularly attractive. This has led to the development of an approach we have called knowledge-infused (deep) learning. This project will advance the currently limited forms of combining the knowledge graphs and deep learning, called shallow and semi-diffusion, with a more advanced form called deep-infusion, that will support stronger interleaving of more variety of knowledge at different levels of abstraction with layers in a deep learning architecture.          This project will investigate the deep knowledge-infusion strategy in two substantial ways. The first is to infuse knowledge of different types from knowledge graphs in the deep learning pipeline. For example, in natural language processing, we will investigate the incorporation of linguistic, common sense, broad-based and domain-specific knowledge. The second is to infuse stratified knowledge representing different levels of abstractions, such as low levels of abstractions contained in raw data measurements that focus on the physical features of an object, and higher levels of abstractions that capture more conceptual aspects of the object, such as the object's functionality in an application. Each deep network layer may take a different type of knowledge representing the intended level of abstraction at that layer. For example in a transformer, we can reparameterize different transformer blocks (layers) such that the transformer block will take a different type of knowledge representing the intended level of abstraction at that layer. Furthermore, the deep infusion pipeline can generate explanations for the outcomes of the deep-learning pipeline from the knowledge graph at the appropriate layer leading to a clear picture of the contextual connection between parts of the input. Both layered abstraction and explanation modules would be highly significant contributions towards improving the state of machine intelligence.

Each has its own strengths and limitations. To get the best of each, a smart environment may use multiple IoT platforms. However, when multiple IoT platforms coexist in the same physical space, many unique problems arise, which are referred to as Multi-Platform Coexistence (MPC) problems. The objectives of the project are systematically to describe, categorize and measure MPC problems and design and build effective solutions to address them. Multiple platforms for a smart environment do not necessarily share consistent observations about IoT device states. As a result, automation applications installed on these platforms may issue incorrect and even conflicting commands. In addition, the assumption made by existing work that a single platform has a complete view and control of all IoT devices does not hold true. Thus, the project is to uncover, measure, and formalize unique problems due to coexistence and interaction of multiple IoT platforms in the same physical space, and propose novel designs, techniques, algorithms and build systems to resolve them. The project can benefit numerous smart-environment users and related industries by revealing and handling MPC problems and supporting harmonious coexistence of IoT platforms.

Unfortunately, existing methane conversion processes are energetically inefficient, resulting in significant carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. One promising alternative to existing processes for methane activation is low temperature, aqueous electrochemical conversion as promoted by catalysts. When paired with renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, electrocatalytic processes can theoretically achieve completely CO2-free production of chemicals and fuels from methane. To that end, the project investigates various electrocatalytic methane reaction pathways, with the eventual goal of enabling the development of inexpensive, efficient, and economical fuels and chemicals, such as methanol. Specifically, the project will combine two high-level scientific aims to investigate five known pathways to create the surface-active oxygen species needed to enable the methane-to-methanol reaction. The first aim focuses on identifying the types of activated oxygen species and the effects of electrochemical potential on reaction selectivity and activity. For each active oxygen pathway, the second aim focuses on identifying the rate determining step by combining in-situ characterization of the surface species during reaction with electrochemical data. Together the two aims combine standard electrochemical techniques with surface enhanced infrared spectroscopy, isotope labeling and GC/MS product characterization to uncover the rate, selectivity, and reaction order for each pathway. To enable the five pathways, only 3 different catalysts are needed: oxidized polycrystalline Pt, RuO2 and NiO:ZrO2. The number of catalyst chemistries and form factors are purposely limited, to promote a depth of understanding that can inform further development of additional catalysts that have even greater activity towards methane activation and selectivity for methanol formation. The fundamental understanding generated through the scientific aims will be fed directly to two undergraduate-led engineering activities, allowing for strong integration of research and education. Laboratory-based undergraduate research will focus on integrating down-selected catalysts into new reactor schemes.

Key challenges addressed are: (i) understanding non-equilibrium energy transfer and transformation of matters in plasma catalysis; (ii) identifying methods to stabilize plasma without impacting its efficiency; (iii) coordination between plasma properties and catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in chemical conversion; (iv) development of experimentally validated, predictive kinetic and transport models for novel plasma catalysts and reactor co-design; and (v) elucidating reactor design and manufacturing criteria that optimize plasma and catalyst integration. The studies will advance fundamental understanding of plasma catalysis by conducting advanced laser diagnostics of non-equilibrium plasma properties, excited states, and chemistry, and by developing experimentally validated predictive multiscale modeling tools for plasma chemistry and transformation of matter in plasma catalysis.

This project combines researchers at Princeton University, University of South Carolina, and Stanford University with expertise in catalysis, plasma physics and chemistry, and nanomanufacturing with national laboratories and industry to provide a variety of research and educational initiatives that will nurture future U.S. leaders and innovators in energy and engineering sciences and technology. The project is supported by a broadening participation plan to attract underrepresented minority (URM) students (e.g. high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students) for summer on-campus learning programs, industrial internships, and thesis research. Such emphasis aligns with the team�s educational goal of creating a pipeline in science and engineering for students from high school through college and advanced degrees. Further, collaborations with national laboratories and industry and the formation of the Center Advisory Board and Industrial Consortium will facilitate the innovation and technology transfer to market. Renewable electricity from solar and wind provides unprecedented opportunities for distributed reactors using low-temperature, non-equilibrium atmospheric misty plasma catalysis. The overarching project goal is to investigate the plasma-assisted catalytic conversion of methane to higher-order liquid hydrocarbons and oxygenated fuels and chemicals. Key challenges addressed are: (i) understanding non-equilibrium energy transfer and transformation of matters in plasma catalysis; (ii) identifying methods to stabilize plasma without impacting its efficiency; (iii) coordination between plasma properties and catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability in chemical conversion; (iv) development of experimentally validated, predictive kinetic and transport models for novel plasma catalysts and reactor co-design; and (v) elucidating reactor design and manufacturing criteria that optimize plasma and catalyst integration. The studies will advance fundamental understanding of plasma catalysis by conducting advanced laser diagnostics of non-equilibrium plasma properties, excited states, and chemistry, and by developing experimentally validated predictive multiscale modeling tools for plasma chemistry and transformation of matter in plasma catalysis. Moreover, elements of hybrid plasma control, catalyst design, and additive manufacturing will be employed to develop an innovative micro-aerosol plasma catalytic reactor (MAPCAR) as a modular device to enable efficient and selective conversion of abundant feedstocks such as stranded natural gas and CO2, to liquid fuels and oxygenated chemical precursors.

The novelty of the approach taken in this project is to tune hyper-parameters to facilitate the use of an array of concurrent models to hide training latency. More specifically, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are used to store and update the parameters of multiple concurrent long short-term memory networks as well as embed physical knowledge at the neurons' input level. This will require that the machine learning algorithm learn the temporal dependencies across operating regimes and adapt to varying dynamics. The resulting algorithm is a novel type of long short-term memory recurrent neural network that enables the prediction of nonlinear and non-stationary time series. Multiple iterations of this algorithm will be run in parallel on a single FPGA where the training time of one algorithm can be effectively hidden by another algorithm performing inference in parallel. The formulated algorithm will advance the field of real-time machine learning by furthering knowledge on: 1) how parallel models interact to hide training latency; 2) the effect of automated tuning of model parameters; 3) the role of physical knowledge in designing input spaces; 4) the benefits of subdividing non-stationary time series into local stationary systems; and 5) sustaining sufficient accuracy while meeting real-time constraints in the micro-second realm.","[550.0, 523.0, 519.0, 518.0, 504.0, 537.0, 533.0, 516.0, 521.0, 543.0]",0

While no communities have been spared, small and rural communities face unique challenges in confronting the opioid epidemic: knowledge and data exist in siloes across multiple organizations with varying jurisdictional boundaries; efforts to collect, link, and analyze data are hampered by a lack of infrastructure and tools; rural areas are plagued by ""dead zones"" in cellular connectivity; communities lack capacity for data collection, and analytics; needs and resources across effected communities are not uniform and require BD approaches that are flexible, open, leverage significant community input, and can be dutifully validated. Our proposed solution is OpenOD, a framework that provides uniform, relevant and timely access to data. Working integrally with the Midwest Big Data Hub (MBDH) and our partners, our three main objectives are to: (1) Work with local communities to understand strengths and gaps in cyberinfrastructure, data availability, and need for data analytics workforce skills. (2) Assemble flexible cyberinfrastructure that includes a data commons, stakeholder-usable and cloud-amenable data analytics and visualization tools, and internet connectivity with both mobile and non-mobile capabilities. (3) Validate, evaluate, and disseminate cyberinfrastructure and data analytics tools to stakeholder groups throughout the region while fostering new partnerships. OpenOD will create approaches that will allow governing units to deploy openly available tools rather than rely on proprietary tools. In this way, existing disparities in data access and ensuing responses are effectively addressed. The potential contributions of the project are to: (1) Increase BD and STEM literacy and community engagement in underrepresented groups given the operating milieu of OpenOD in rural areas where the population is indigent and lacks adequate skills to join the modern workforce. (2) Improve well-being of individuals in society by linking data sources in new and useful ways to empower communities to address the opioid crisis; improved connectivity and timely delivery of critical information will accelerate community responsiveness and improve preventive strategies. (3) Provide infrastructure for research and education will be improved given that project activities will deliver linked, curated data sets to community stakeholders, researchers and educators. Training modules and courses adapted and developed and shared with local/regional educators and will remain with the communities after the funding period has ended. In addition, new and established partnerships will allow sustainability of the project in the communities for the long-term. The opioid crisis ravaging Ohio and the Midwest disproportionally affects small and rural communities. Harnessing and deploying data holds promise for developing a response to this crisis by policymakers, healthcare providers, and citizens of the communities. Currently, there are many barriers to getting data into the hands of individuals on the frontlines. Crucial data are siloed across law enforcement, public health departments, hospitals and clinics, and county administrations; data often are inaccurate or collected in non-standard ways across different agencies and departments; the stigma of drug abuse limits accurate reporting of drug-related deaths; and information is not shared with the community and other stakeholders because of the lack of a privacy and security framework. Such barriers, for example, prevent individuals with addictions or their families and friends from locating available treatment centers or obtaining other important information in a timely way. Similarly, it is difficult for first responders and healthcare providers to obtain critical up-to-date information. In predominantly rural counties, these challenges are especially daunting because there is often poor connectivity and communication infrastructure. This Big Data Spoke project involves developing scalable, flexible, and connectivity-rich data-driven approaches to address the opioid epidemic. The cyberinfrastructure framework, OpenOD, will be initially designed and deployed in small and rural communities in Appalachia Ohio and the Midwest, where the need for data and connection are greatest. Based upon significant community input, OpenOD will also create end-user applications or enterprise solutions to support stakeholders and communities to mount a response they feel will be most efficient and beneficial at the local level.

High performance carbon and glass fibers are widely used as reinforcements in composite material systems for automotive, aerospace and defense applications. The tensile strength of commercial fibers is significantly less than its theoretical limits. The composite systems are often overdesigned, thus any increase in the fiber tensile strength can yield significant cost and weight savings. Modifications of fiber surface treatment (sizing) during manufacturing is a potential route to enhance the fiber strength. Single fiber tensile testing at millimeter-scale is typically used to characterize the effect of sizing on the fiber strength. However, the longitudinal tensile failure of a composite is governed by the fiber strength distribution and defects at microscale lengths. This award supports the fundamental research that overcomes current challenges in characterizing the tensile strength of the fibers at the microscale using experimental and data-driven computational methods. Besides the scientific understanding, this project will also provide a guiding template for the fiber manufacturing process through controlled surface treatment. A direct consequence of improving the tensile strength would be lightweight structures for applications in aerospace, automotive, and sports equipment sectors. As part of this project, a specific effort will also be aimed at recruiting graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups through the Society for Women Engineers at the University of South Carolina. Furthermore, the experimental setup developed in this research will be incorporated into a lab course for undergraduate students.  A comprehensive understanding of the discrepancy between experimental tensile strength of commercial fibers and its theoretical limits has been elusive, and whether intrinsic fiber strength follows a Weibull statistical distribution remains an open question. This research aims to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that govern the tensile strength of fibers at microscale gage lengths. Experimental and data-driven techniques will be employed to study the strength distribution of the fibers at microscales. Microscale gage lengths will be accessed by developing a novel in situ transverse loading experiment on single fibers under scanning electron microscope combined with micro-digital image correlation. Data-driven machine learning techniques will be applied to establish the scaling laws of strength. This research will provide new insights into the functional form of the survival probability and strength-controlling mechanisms in fibers influenced by fiber sizing. This new fundamental knowledge of processing (sizing)-structure (defect distribution)-property (tensile strength distribution) relationship at microscale lengths will enable the establishment of scaling laws for strength and will serve as a guide for fiber manufacturing process to enhance the fiber tensile strength.","[530.0, 550.0, 509.0, 577.0, 578.0, 559.0, 560.0, 515.0, 563.0, 529.0]",0

Additionally, graph-based GAN models will be used for MOF topology exploration and can be applied to other nanomaterials designs. More specifically, the investigators will: 1) develop and exploit physics-based models for fast calculation of properties such as diffusivity, ion conductivity, and mechanical stability; 2) develop generative adversarial network (GAN) models with built-in physics rules for efficient exploration of the chemical design space for both MOF materials and solid electrolytes; 3) use persistence homology and Bravais lattice sequence representations of MOF materials and solid electrolytes, respectively, to build Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models for fast and accurate prediction of the physical properties of generated materials; 4) apply high-level quantum-mechanical calculations for verification of discovered materials. Accomplishments from this project will lead to accelerated discovery of novel nanostructured materials for gas separation and energy storage, materials for lithium-ion batteries, novel data-driven scheme for materials design, and theoretical methods enabling implementation of advanced data science techniques.

This project addresses this grand challenge with a specific focus on finding metal organic framework (MOF) materials that are used to separate gas mixtures and finding better battery materials for energy storage. The PIs will combine theoretical methods from statistical mechanics and condensed-matter physics, and physics-based models, to generate information-rich materials data which is integrated with generative machine learning (ML) algorithms to search a complex chemical design space efficiently and to train deep learning models for fast screening of materials properties.

U.S. has the greatest medical science in the world, that is unable to provide consistent, affordable care for all citizens. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) attributes more than 100,000 deaths a year to preventable medical errors, resulting from system lapses that fail to deliver well-established standards of practice. Quality, safety, and coordination issues suggest that barriers to transforming U.S. healthcare are complex system engineering problems. Efforts to share information across healthcare systems has many unaddressed barriers. This planning grant is driven by a vision of an Engineering Research Center for Health Care Transformation (ERC-HCT) focused on reengineering delivery of healthcare through a multi-pronged approach that integrates information technology, systems engineering, social sciences, medical science, and health informatics. The primary aim is to advance the science for reengineering U.S. health care delivery from today's costly, inconsistent provider-centric system to a better coordinated person-centered care system. This vision, guided by medical professionals, industry partners, and behavioral scientists, will create care improvements and sustainable, scalable integrated delivery models. The Planning Grant will engage partners to develop a common, deeper understanding of barriers and opportunities afforded by today's technologies as a basis for clarifying strategies and shaping the management structure of the proposed Engineering Research Center. This planning grant brings together a diverse team of researchers from the University of South Carolina, Clemson University, Claflin, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, and the PRISMA Health System, to develop a common, deeper understanding of barriers and opportunities afforded by today?s technologies. ERC-HCT will bring together expertise and research that generally functions in silos, eluding significant progress in system-level transformation. While most funded healthcare translational research supports evidence-based medicine, the proposed ERC-HCT fills a gap by addressing healthcare delivery optimization at a system level, a stubbornly intractable challenge. We will focus on advancing the fundamental sciences essential to address four key research thrusts: care coordination, clinical decision support, population health management, and personalized health. Sciences to be addressed include artificial intelligence, data science, biomedicine, health IT, complex system engineering, and human-computer interaction. Research will inform healthcare practice, payment, public policy, and provide a rich innovation ecosystem to prepare future leaders and attract new innovative researchers to partner universities, contributing to sustainability. As stakeholders work toward solutions, we anticipate that their views will coalesce around realistic possibilities and pathways forward for achieving the vision for a better engineered, patient-centered healthcare delivery system.

The proposed curriculum will also include a training standard recognized by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) to meet the CNSS 4011 training standard. Second, NNMC and USF will establish an alliance with industry organizations and with Los Alamos National Laboratories (LANL), including Engineering/IT divisions at LANL and its National Security Education Center (NSEC), to create an internship program in cybersecurity. The alliance will strengthen the collaboration with industry and federal laboratories, in efforts to bolster national security. Third, NNMC will partner with the New Mexico Department of Workforce Solutions and a regional rural high-school to strengthen the cybersecurity pipeline and increase the production of professionals to fill regional demand. Finally, the educational model and curricular material will be available and further disseminated through well-established channels, such as the Western Academy Support and Training Center (WASTC). WASTC provides computer science and IT training across the country and supports hundreds of higher education institutions that have interest in adopting vLabs.  This project proposes to implement a cybersecurity concentration embedded in the Bachelor degree in Information Engineering Technology at Northern New Mexico College (NNMC). The concentration will consist of two regular core courses, two Capstone courses, and one internship experience. The program of studies will also include three cybersecurity-infused prerequisite courses involving computers, networking, and programming essentials.

This project is aimed towards filling in the gap in the present understanding and mathematical modeling of plasma discharges in liquids. A study of the fundamental mechanisms of complex and inter-related processes by which a plasma discharge initiates, interacts and sustains in the liquid medium will also have substantial benefits outside the field of plasma science. Unique and critical technologies envisioned to have the greatest impact are biomedical - wound healing and sterilization, electronics - nano-particle synthesis, and energy efficiency - high-efficiency combustion from liquid fuel reforming. This project will computationally investigate plasma discharges in liquids using advanced numerical methods in conjunction with high-performance computing resources.

In particular, the PIs have demonstrated ultraviolet (UV) photodetection with high gain in devices featuring a transparent epitaxial graphene (EG) emitter grown on a p-type SiC base epilayer on n-type SiC substrates. Ultraviolet (UV) detection is an important capability for military, industrial, chemical, and biological applications. However, UV makes up only a small portion of the daylight spectrum and visible light absorption can easily overwhelm the typical UV signal, making the inherent visible blindness found in wide-bandgap semiconductors (such as SiC) therefore a desirable quality for UV detectors if architectures with high detectivity and UV-transparent contacts (such as epitaxial graphene) can be identified. Accordingly this grant supports the development and study of Schottky-emitter bipolar phototransistor (SEPT) devices including detailed analysis using scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM). The devices rely on high-efficiency injection of minority carriers in Schottky-based devices, an unconventional process that could transform many fields of electronics from flexible displays for consumer electronics, to optoelectronics, to power electronics. For example, a graphene-emitter bipolar transistor will enable high frequency, high power, low loss operation of smartgrids, offering performance superior to that available from either traditional silicon devices, or the latest GaN or SiC devices, considered the gold-standards in power electronics. The physics of Schottky minority carrier injection would be transformative in developing hole-injectors for light-emitting diodes (LEDs), currently a challenge in materials such as GaN, enabling low-cost solid-state lighting, or in solar cells. The PIs are additionally committed to development of a diverse science and engineering workforce through graduate training and K-12 outreach. This project will directly support research workshops on solar energy and stipends for 10 students/year from historically Black colleges and universities in the Columbia, SC area, culminating in presentations at the USC Sustainability Showcase organized by Co-PI.   In most Schottky junctions, thermionic emission dominates, and minority carrier injection efficiency gamma <20% is observed, insufficient for high performance devices despite the potential high speed that Schottky electrodes offer. Results at the PI's labs on the transparent epitaxial graphene (EG)/p-SiC Schottky interface have demonstrated bipolar photocurrent gain bipolar phototransistor current gain beta >100 in response to 365nm UV radiation, indicative of highly efficient minority injection (gamma >95%). This behavior is hypothesized to occur due to i) the large Schottky barrier of EG/p-SiC (2.7eV), larger than the bandgap of many materials and ii) the large ratio of the mobility of the minority carriers (electrons) to that of the majority carriers (holes) in SiC. The ultimate goal of this project is to make EG/SiC Schottky emitter phototransistors that approach or beat UV avalanche photodiode performance ~102-3A/W (365nm) at much lower voltages (~10s V vs.>300 V), leading to lower dark current and noise. The PIs will use SEPT devices formed at the University of South Carolina to interrogate the transport of minority carriers at Schottky junctions using frequency, time, spatially resolved optical measurements, as well as temperature dependent DC measurements. The use of the only natively grown Schottky interface EG/SiC enables systematic tuning of the interfacial properties using H-intercalation, and by exposure to polar gas ambients such as H2O, NO2 and NH3, which the PIs will use to control minority carrier injection. They will also investigate the role of stacking fault formation under bipolar injection, a key aging process, as well as how stacking faults determine the responsivity, speed, and visible rejection of the devices. Finally, the project will permit continued collaboration with the Naval Research Laboratory.","[561.0, 562.0, 540.0, 536.0, 550.0, 548.0]",0

The study of micro-and nano-fluidics has great potential to revolutionize the methods in biological and chemical applications, which has wide applications to the design of systems in which low volumes of fluids are processed to achieve multiplexing, automation, and high-throughput screening. Micro- and nano-fluidics is used widely in the development of inkjet printheads, DNA chips, lab-on-a-chip technology, micro-propulsion, and micro-thermal technologies. The project will also provide advanced interdisciplinary training to graduate and undergraduate students. All of these activities will have broad and long-lasting impacts and contribute directly to the intellectual infrastructure of the nation. Nonlocal models such as fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs), fractional Laplacian, and peridynamics are emerging as powerful tools for modeling challenging phenomena including anomalous transport and long-range time memory or spatial interactions in a wide range of fields such as biology, physics, chemistry, finance, engineering, and solute transport in groundwater. These models provide more appropriate description of many important problems in applications than integer-order PDE models do. Two of the main reasons that nonlocal models have not been used extensively so far are as follows: (1) They generate numerical schemes with dense matrices and solutions with strongly local behavior, which are significantly more expensive to solve numerically than traditional integer-order PDE models. A naive simulation of a three-dimensional linear problem with a moderate number of grid points may take state of the art supercomputers hundreds of years to finish and so deemed unrealistic. (2) Nonlocal models introduce mathematical difficulties, which were not encountered in the context of integer-order PDEs. It is proposed to effectively address both points at this juncture. The fast numerical methods proposed herein will provide significant computational benefits for nonlocal models, and will facilitate their applications. Preliminary numerical experiments of a simple three-dimensional fractional PDE showed that the proposed method reduced the CPU time from 2 months and 25 days by a traditional method to 5.74 seconds and reduced storage significantly. The proposed mathematical and numerical analysis will provide a solid theoretical foundation for nonlocal models and related numerical approximations. The fast and accurate numerical methods and rigorous mathematical analysis results will be applied in the development of a novel mathematical modeling of micro- and nano-fluidics. The resulting mathematical model will be utilized in the study of micro- and nano-fluidics.","[536.0, 550.0, 539.0, 571.0]",0

The current cathodes for IT-SOFCs are nanostructured with high catalytic activity, but are unfortunately unstable, gradually losing their activity during operation. This project focuses on stabilizing nanostructured cathodes with atomic layer deposition (ALD) and understanding the reason behind why stability and activity of nanostructured cathodes are significantly enhanced by the ALD process.

The project supports one female graduate student and one minority undergraduate student. TECHNICAL DETAILS: A key to the success of IT-SOFCs is to develop highly active and stable cathodes. The current nanostructured active cathodes are unstable at elevated temperatures. This project is aimed at developing active and stable nanostructured cathodes and investigating the fundamental science underpinning the enhanced catalytic activity and stability through an integrated ""theoretical hypothesis"" and ""experimental validation"" approach.
