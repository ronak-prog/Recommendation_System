While the degree of underrepresentation varies among STEM disciplines women s advancement to senior professorial ranks and leadership roles is an issue in all fields . The underrepresentation of women is also a critical issue for the nation at large as its need to develop a globally competitive and diverse workforce increases . Research has shown that women s representation and advancement in academic STEM positions are affected by many external factors that are unrelated to their ability interest and technical skills Spencer et al 1999 Halpern and Tan 2001 Hyde 2005 National Academy of Sciences 2007 . Such factors include but are not limited to stereotype threat societal impacts organizational constraints of academic institutions differential effect of work and family demands implicit and explicit bias and lack of women in academic leadership and decision making positions . The cumulative effect of such diverse factors has been to create infrastructural barriers that impact the number of women entering persisting and advancing in STEM careers . Thus the goal of the ADVANCE program is to develop systemic approaches to increase the representation and advancement of women in academic STEM careers thereby contributing to the development of a more diverse science and engineering workforce .

The problems of recruitment retention and advancement that are the causes of this underrepresentation vary by discipline and across groups of women faculty e . g . by race ethnicity disability status sexual orientation foreign born and foreign trained status and faculty appointment type . The ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of all women faculty in academic institutions . Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in areas such as policy practice culture and organizational climate . For example practices in academic departments that result in the inequitable allocation of service or teaching assignments may impede research productivity delay advancement and create a culture of differential treatment and rewards . Policies and procedures that do not mitigate implicit bias in hiring tenure and promotion decisions could mean that women and underrepresented minorities are evaluated less favorably perpetuating their underrepresentation and contributing to a climate that is not inclusive . The goals of the ADVANCE program are 1 to develop systemic approaches to increase the representation and advancement of women in academic STEM 1 careers 2 to develop innovative and sustainable ways to promote gender equity that involve both men and women in the STEM academic workforce and 3 to contribute to the research knowledge base on gender equity and the intersection of gender and other identities in STEM academic careers . The ADVANCE program contributes to the development of a more diverse science and engineering workforce because of the focus on equity for STEM academic faculty who are educating training and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral scholars . There are three program tracks . All projects are expected to build on prior ADVANCE work and gender equity research and literature to broaden the implementation of organizational and systemic strategies to foster gender equity in STEM academic careers . All ADVANCE proposals are expected to recognize that gender does not exist in isolation from other characteristics such as race ethnicity disability status sexual orientation foreign born and foreign trained status faculty appointment type etc . and should offer strategies to promote gender equity for all faculty The Institutional Transformation IT track supports the development of innovative organizational change strategies to produce comprehensive change within one non profit two year or four year academic institution across all STEM disciplines . IT projects are also expected to contribute new research on gender equity in STEM academics . Projects that do not propose innovative strategies may be more appropriate for the Adaptation track . The Adaptation track supports the adaptation and implementation of evidence based organizational change strategies ideally from among those developed and implemented by ADVANCE projects . Adaptation awards may support the adaptation and implementation of proven organizational change strategies within a non profit two year or four year academic institution that has not had an ADVANCE IT award . Adaptation awards may also be made to a STEM organization to implement systemic change strategies focused across all STEM disciplines several STEM disciplines or within one STEM discipline . The Partnership track will support partnerships of two or more non profit academic institutions and or STEM organizations to increase gender equity in STEM academics .

The current solicitation is intended to complement previous NSF investments in advanced computational infrastructure by exploring new and creative approaches to delivering innovative computational resources to an increasingly diverse community and portfolio of scientific research and education . NSF s vision for Advanced Computing Infrastructure which supports Cyberinfrastructure Framework for 21st Century Science and Engineering CIF21 focuses specifically on ensuring that the science and engineering community has ready access to the advanced computational and data driven capabilities required to tackle the most complex problems and issues facing today s scientific and educational communities . To accomplish these goals requires advanced computational capabilities within the context of a multilevel comprehensive and innovative infrastructure that benefits all fields of science and engineering . Previous solicitations have concentrated on enabling petascale capability through the deployment and support of a world class High Performance Computing HPC environment . In the past decade NSF has provided the open science and engineering community with a number of state of the art HPC assets ranging from loosely coupled clusters to large scale instruments with many thousands of computing cores communicating via fast interconnects and more recently with diverse heterogeneous architectures . Recent developments in computational science have begun to focus on complex dynamic and diverse workflows which integrate computation into all areas of the scientific process . Some of these involve applications that are extremely data intensive and may not be dominated by floating point operation speed . While a number of the earlier acquisitions have addressed a subset of these issues the previous solicitation NSF 13 528 and the current solicitation emphasize these aspects even further . Currently NSF operates through Blue Waters and the eXtreme Digital XD program a two tiered comprehensive distributed Cyberinfrastructure CI which is one of the largest and most powerful in the world . Through these and related projects the open science and engineering community is currently capable of tackling many of the most challenging scientific problems across multiple science and engineering domains . Both of these tiers are explicitly designed to address needs beyond the campus level . With this solicitation NSF intends to continue this model to broaden the CI capabilities above the campus level while promoting deeper campus engagement . The resources supported under this solicitation will be incorporated into and allocated as part of the XD tier of national shared resources . The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment XSEDE integrates resources from the XD tier and will provide shared services for this resource in the form of allocations user support training education and outreach services an XSEDE wide file system which connects all the resources and campus bridging . Additional XD shared services provided include the following the Technical Inspection Service TIS dedicated to the evaluation of software and providing recommendations to XSEDE on the use of that software and the Technical Audit Service TAS dedicated to providing metrics for the systems supported within XD and also to the evaluation of applications on the XD systems . The TAS operates XDMoD a publically available and easily usable tool to extract a broad array of information concerning the way the XD resources are providing services to the open science community . The current solicitation is intended to complement previous NSF investments in advanced computational infrastructure by exploring new and creative approaches to delivering computational resources to the scientific community . Consistent with the Advanced Computing Infrastructure Vision and Strategic Plan February 2012 the current solicitation is focused on expanding the use of high end resources to a much larger and more diverse community . To quote from that strategic plan the goal is to . . . position and support the entire spectrum of NSF funded communities . . . and to promote a more comprehensive and balanced portfolio . . . . to support multidisciplinary computational and data enabled science and engineering that in turn supports the entire scientific engineering and educational community . Thus while continuing to provide essential and needed resources to the more traditional users of HPC this solicitation expands the horizon to include research communities that are not users of traditional HPC systems but who would benefit from advanced computational capabilities at the national level . Building testing and deploying these resources within the collaborative ecosystem that encompasses national regional and campus resources continues to remain a high priority for NSF and one of increasing importance to the science and engineering community . Resource Providers those organizations willing to acquire deploy and operate NSF supported resources in service to the science and engineering research and education community play a key role in the provision and support of a national Cyberinfrastructure . With this solicitation NSF requests proposals from organizations willing to serve as Resource Providers within the eXtreme Digital XD program . In the past NSF has acquired and deployed these systems to the S E community using the shared services model of the XSEDE project as described above . In that model the resources are allocated via a competitive process defined by NSF and managed by the XSEDE Resource Allocations Committee XRAC . Depending on the type of resources and the objectives defined by the proposers that process may require some accommodation or modification as is discussed below . Competitive proposals must address one or more of the following Complementing existing XD capabilities with new types of computational resources attuned to less traditional computational science communities Incorporating innovative and reliable services within the HPC environment to deal with complex and dynamic workflows that contribute significantly to the advancement of science and are difficult to achieve within XD Introducing new flexible and highly usable capabilities such as cloud computing into XD to meet national scale requirements for new modes of computationally intensive scientific research Introducing new capabilities and or reaching new communities by establishing novel highly usable connections to other non XD parts of the national cyberinfrastructure . For example these might include connections to other domain specific centers housing software sensors or instrument data thus enabling new advances in computational science Exploring new effective modes of engagement with campus cyberinfrastructure Expanding the range of computationally challenging science and engineering applications that can be tackled with current XD resources . Again ease of access and usability are critical andProviding reliable approaches to scientific communities needing a flexible and user friendly environment . This can be achieved in a variety of ways and the proposal should explicitly provide details on how that would be achieved by their approach . An important aspect of the current solicitation is that hardware acquisition must provide a high degree of stability and usability by no later than January 2016 . Note that proposals to add new and innovative features to currently deployed systems are eligible for consideration . In past solicitations benchmarks have played an important role . Two types of benchmarks were required NSF provided and proposer selected benchmarks . For this solicitation given the emphasis on nontraditional HPC as well as possible cloud like solutions and the potential breadth in targeted scientific impact NSF has opted not to require a set of NSF provided benchmarks . Nonetheless we still require that each proposer provide a convincing demonstration with hard data that their system will perform as described in their proposal . Benchmarks certainly can address applications that are currently used by the NSF computational science community but must also provide compelling evidence of the expanded scientific diversity and new communities that will be reached from the innovative aspects of the proposed resource . Clearly the details of the submitted benchmark results will depend on the nature of the proposed resource and are likely to differ from one submission to the next .,"The current solicitation is intended to complement previous NSF investments in advanced computational infrastructure by exploring new and creative approaches to delivering innovative computational resources to an increasingly diverse community and portfolio of scientific research and education .

The Political Science Program in the Directorate for Social Behavioral and Economic Sciences expects to make two awards for the 2020 Presidential election cycle with the award to run from fiscal years 2018 to 2021 . We anticipate that NSF will make two awards totaling no more than 11 . 5 million over four years . One will be for the traditional face to face survey . The second will be for a web based survey . While these will be independent awards the two awardees will be expected to work closely together . The expected start date is July 2018 . ANES started in 1948 . Since then the project has conducted a survey during each presidential election . One of the unique attributes of ANES is that for each election respondents have been surveyed prior to the Presidential election and then after the election . These pre and post surveys provide a unique look at how Americans participate in politics and why . These cross sectional surveys have been conducted using random sampling with the sampling scheme being relatively stable over time . The content of the survey has also stayed relatively stable over time though there has been the introduction of new topics the deletion of old topics and changes in question wording . To insure the integrity of the survey it was decided in 1977 that the principal investigator s would be advised by a national Board of Overseers that would be representative of the community of scholars interested in American national elections . The National Science Foundation has helped to support this enterprise since 1970 . During this period the survey has been conducted primarily using a face to face design where trained interviewers go into households to conduct their interviews . In addition to face to face surveys ANES has conducted mode comparisons using random digit dialing RDD and in recent years web based platforms . ANES has also conducted several other enhancements . For instance several panel studies have been conducted including a 29 wave panel study conducted around the 2008 election . Other innovations have included oversamples of African Americans oversamples of Hispanics with the instrument translated into Spanish and surveys conducted by bi lingual interviewers experimentation with new instrumentation recruitment of respondents etc .,"The American National Election Studies ANES produce high quality data from its own surveys on voting public opinion and political participation .

The Antarctic Artists and Writers Program provides opportunities for professional artists and writers to travel to Antarctica at research stations field camps and aboard ships to make the observations necessary to complete their proposed projects . While the majority of award recipients are established artists and writers the program also seeks to support early career artists and writers in an effort to broaden participation . This program is intended for individuals or small teams who would make use of existing limited resources without requiring substantial dedicated support or a significant amount of logistical resources . The National Science Foundation funds and manages the U . S . Antarctic Program which is devoted mainly to scientific research and education in support of the national interest in the Antarctic . The program s research and support infrastructure enables access to much of the Antarctic region for selected Antarctic Artists and Writers Program projects . It does not typically provide direct financial support to selected applicants . International Polar YearThe International Polar Year IPY which extends from March 2007 to March 2009 see http dels . nas . edu us ipy and http www . ipy . org is underway .

In the last decade DNA sequences andother data have provided compelling confirmation of many previously inferred relationships provided evidence of unexpected relationships and accelerated the discovery of new clades . The NSF Assembling the Tree ofLife or AToL program has further enabled clarificationof relationships within major groups of organisms . At this point compelling needs are to achieve integration and synthesis of theseseparate phylogenies into a cohesive tree across all of life and to develop new tools for visualizing querying and further analyzing thetree of life . This is a daunting challenge requiring enormous conceptual advances potential use of new kinds of data and characters massive data collection and the development of powerful analytical and visualization techniques . The Assembling Visualizing and Analyzing the Tree of Life AVAToL activity supports novel and transformative approaches to the development of an integrated and robust tree of life as well as visualizationand analysis on a dynamic tree of life . This will take place through the Ideas Lab project development and review process . The goal of thisactivity is to identify opportunities for investment to significantly advance the state of the art in tree construction visualization andanalysis across the tree of life . Participants selected through an open application process will engage in an intensive five day residentialworkshop to generate project ideas through an innovative real time review process . New multidisciplinary teams will form during thisworkshop to engage in creative problem solving directed at outstanding problems concerning the tree of life . Multidisciplinary integrativeapproaches calling for communication and interaction among diverse scientists are key to the success of the approach .

As part of this initiative the Administration encouraged multiple stakeholders including federal agencies private industry academia state and local governments non profits and foundations to develop and participate in Big Data research and innovation projects across the country . To augment ongoing activities and to ignite new Big Data public private partnerships across the Nation NSF s Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE is seeking to establish a National Network of Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs BD Hubs . Each BD Hub would be a consortium of members from academia industry and or government . This solicitation aims to establish four Hubs across distinct geographic regions of the United States including the Northeast Midwest South and West as defined later in the Program Description section . Each BD Hub should focus on key Big Data challenges and opportunities for its region of service . The BD Hubs should aim to support the breadth of interested local stakeholders within their respective regions while members of a BD Hub should strive to achieve common Big Data goals that would not be possible for the independent members to achieve alone . To foster collaboration among prospective partners within a region NSF is sponsoring a series of regional intensive one day workshops called charrettes . One charrette will be held in each geographic region to convene stakeholders explore Big Data challenges and aid in the establishment of that consortium . For more information on these charrettes see the following webpage http www . usenix . org BDHubs15 . To facilitate discussion among interested parties a HUBzero community portal has been established at http bdhub . info . Interested parties may leverage this portal to communicate with members within their region or other stakeholders nationwide . This solicitation is the first of a multi phase process meant to develop a National Network of BD Hubs . The first phase will set up the governance structure of each BD Hub s consortium of members as well as develop approaches to ensure cross hub collaboration and sustainability over the long term . The next phase will focus on building out various sectors of particular interest to each BD Hub e . g . transportation smart cities health energy public safety and education so as to advance sector innovation in that region . The final phases will focus on connecting the BD Hubs and their regional sectors into a national Big Data innovation ecosystem . This solicitation is part of NSF s Big Data program which includes research and infrastructure development education and workforce development and multi disciplinary collaborative teams and communities that address complex science and engineering grand challenges . Before preparing a proposal in response to this or any other Big Data solicitation applicants are strongly encouraged to review those solicitations and consult with cognizant NSF program officers to determine appropriateness of fit . For example this solicitation funds the establishment and coordination of a BD Hubs National Network but is not meant to be a source of funding for new research .

The BD Hubs provide the ability to engage local or regional stakeholders e . g . city county and state governments local industry and non profits and regional academic institutions in big data research and permit a focus on regional issues . These collaborative activities and partnerships play a critical role in building and sustaining a successful national big data innovation ecosystem . This solicitation continues the operation of a national network of BD Hubs . It builds on demonstrated strengths of the program which has grown to include a set of BD Spokes affiliated with the BD Hubs and is responsive to the recent developments in data science . For instance the recently released report on Data Science for Undergraduates Opportunities and Options from the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine exemplifies the urgency of multi faceted education and training in data science . The BD Hubs will continue to nucleate regional collaborations and multi sector projects while fostering innovation in data science . The NSF BD Hubs program is aligned with NSF s Harnessing the Data Revolution HDR Big Idea one of NSF s 10 Big Ideas for Future Investment . HDR is a visionary national scale activity to enable new modes of data driven discovery allowing fundamentally new questions to be asked and answered in science and engineering frontiers generating new knowledge and understanding and accelerating discovery and innovation . The HDR vision is realized via a coordinated set of program solicitations resulting in an ecosystem of interrelated activities enabling i research in the foundations of data science frameworks algorithms and systems for data science and data driven research in science and engineering ii advanced cyberinfrastructure and iii education and workforce development all of which are designed to amplify the intrinsically multidisciplinary nature of the data science challenge .

To this end NSF s Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE initiated the National Network of Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs BD Hubs program to foster multi sector collaborations among academia industry and government . Four BD Hubs have been established one each in the Midwest Northeast South and West regions of the country see Introduction for regional definitions . The BD Hubs are expected to serve a convening and coordinating role helping to bring together a wide range of Big Data stakeholders in order to connect solution seekers with solution providers . This Big Data Regional Innovation Hubs Establishing Spokes to Advance Big Data Applications BD Spokes solicitation extends the BD Hubs network by establishing multi institutional and multi sector collaborations i . e . across academia industry government non profits etc . focused on topics of specific interest to a given region which build upon the capabilities and strengths of said region . Working in concert with the corresponding regional BD Hub a BD Spoke would work on a particular topic that requires Big Data approaches and solutions . Each BD Spoke would function similar to a BD Hub in that it will take on a convening and coordinating roll as opposed to primarily carrying out research but with a narrower and goal driven scope . The set of activities managed by a BD Spoke would ensure that progress is made toward providing solutions in the chosen topic area including for example gathering important stakeholders via forums meetings workshops etc . engaging with end users and solution providers via competitions community challenges etc . and forming multi disciplinary teams to tackle questions no single field can solve alone . The regional BD Hub Steering Committee will provide general guidance to the BD Spoke and assist the BD Spoke in coordinating with the national BD Hub network other BD Spokes and the broader innovation ecosystem . The Big Data activities of a BD Spoke will be guided by the following broad themes Accelerating progress towards addressing societal grand challenges relevant to regional and national priority areas Helping automate the Big Data lifecycle andEnabling access to and increasing use of important and valuable available data assets also including international data sets where relevant . This solicitation covers one aspect of NSF s overall Big Data R D portfolio which includes research infrastructure development and provisioning education and workforce development and community engagement . Prior to preparing a proposal in response to this or any other Big Data related solicitation applicants are strongly encouraged to review the solicitation requirements and consult with cognizant NSF program officers to determine appropriateness of fit . For example this solicitation funds the formation of BD Spokes as well as planning grants for future BD Spokes proposals which will primarily carry out collaboration and partnership building activities and will require a topical and collaborative linkage with a specific BD Hub . This solicitation is not meant to fund proposals where fundamental research is the primary activity . If research is a substantial portion of the proposed activities please consult with the cognizant NSF program officer of this solicitation . For example the NSF Critical Techniques and Technologies for Advancing Foundations and Applications of Big Data Science Engineering BIGDATA solicitation may be more relevant for those seeking basic research funding in Foundations and Innovative Applications related to Big Data . Similarly basic privacy research proposals would be more suited to NSF s Secure And Trustworthy Cyberspace SaTC program .

Included minorities are African Americans Hispanics American Indians Alaska Natives Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders . The BPC program seeks to engage the computing community in developing and implementing innovative methods to improve recruitment and retention of these students at the undergraduate and graduate levels . Because the lack of role models in the professoriate can be a barrier to participation the BPC program also aims to develop effective strategies for encouraging individuals to pursue academic careers in computing and become these role models . There are three components to the BPC program Alliances . Broad Alliances of institutions and organizations will design and carry out comprehensive programs that address underrepresentation in the computing disciplines . Alliances will join academic institutions of higher learning with secondary and possibly middle schools government industry professional societies and other not for profit organizations . In most cases Alliances will involve multiple academic institutions of higher learning . Together the participants will 1 develop and implement interventions that support students 2 create sustainable changes in culture and practices at the institutional departmental and organizational levels and 3 serve as models and repositories for effective practices to broaden participation . The emphasis will be on activities that have significant impact both in the quality of opportunities afforded to students and in the number of students potentially served . While the focus is on implementations an Alliance may include complementary research that informs the design of its activities . The leveraging of existing efforts both across and within the underrpresented communities is strongly encouraged . Alliance Extensions . Successful BPC Alliances can propose additional funding to significantly expand the impact of their work .

Together Alliance participants 1 develop and implement interventions that support students and early career faculty 2 create sustainable changes in culture and practices at the institutional departmental and organizational levels 3 serve as models and contribute to repositories for effective practices to broaden participation and 4 leverage the work of existing BP efforts and other Alliances . Competitive projects will have significant impact both in the quality of opportunities afforded to participants and in the number of participants potentially served . Successful Alliances are eligible to compete for additional funding an Alliance Extension increases the duration of the Alliance award as well as its scope introducing additional targeted student groups partners and or projects . Demonstration Projects DPs are more focused than Alliance projects . Typical DPs pilot innovative programs that once fully developed could be incorporated into the activities of an Alliance or otherwise scaled for widespread impact . Projects might for example be proposed by a single institution or might focus on a single underrepresented community a single point in the academic pipeline or a single impediment to full participation in computing . Leveraging Scaling or Adapting LSA Projects are intended to extend the impact of our most effective practices through leveraging scaling and or adaptation . Typical LSA projects will use existing organizational structures and demonstrated best practices . They can leverage the work of BPC funded Alliances or DPs as well as efforts by other organizations . They might for example copy and adapt a successful regional Alliance infrastructure for a new region combine and leverage the work of two or more Alliances adapt an effective intervention for a different audience or take an effective intervention and implement it across an Alliance or other organization with a broad reach . All BPC projects have significant assessment and evaluation efforts with both formative and summative components .,"The BPC program will support three categories of awards Alliances Demonstration Projects and Leveraging Scaling or Adapting Projects .

S . citizens and permanent residents receiving post secondary degrees in the computing disciplines . Initially its emphasis will be on students from communities with longstanding underrepresentation in computing women persons with disabilities and minorities . Included minorities are African Americans Hispanics American Indians Alaska Natives Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders . The BPC program seeks to engage the computing community in developing and implementing innovative methods to improve recruitment and retention of these students at the undergraduate and graduate levels . Because the lack of role models in the professoriate can be a barrier to participation the BPC program also aims to develop effective strategies for identifying and supporting members of the targeted groups who want to pursue academic careers in computing . While these efforts focus on underrepresented groups it is expected that the resulting types of interventions will improve research and education opportunities for all students in computing . There are three components to the BPC program Alliances . Broad Alliances of institutions and organizations will design and carry out comprehensive programs that address underrepresentation in the computing disciplines . Alliances will join academic institutions of higher learning with secondary schools government industry professional societies and other not for profit organizations . Together the participants will 1 develop and implement interventions that support students 2 create sustainable changes in culture and practices at the institutional departmental and organizational levels and 3 serve as models and repositories for effective practices to broaden participation . The emphasis will be on activities that have significant impact both in the quality of opportunities afforded to students and in the number of students potentially served . While the focus is on implementations Alliances may include complementary research that informs the design of those implementations by increasing our understanding of longstanding underrepresentation . The leveraging of existing efforts both across and within the targeted communities is strongly encouraged . Demonstration Projects . Demonstration Projects DPs are smaller in scope and narrower in focus than Alliance projects . Typically DPs will be pilots of programs that once fully developed could be incorporated into the activities of an Alliance . Projects might for example focus on a specific underrepresented community a specific point in the academic pipeline or on a specific impediment to full participation in computing . As in the case of Alliances complementary well defined research aimed at informing the development of the project can be included . Supplements . Supplements to existing CISE grants will be made in order to engage more members of the computing research community in significant BPC efforts .

A complex system is characterized by its display of patterns of structure or behavior at one level of organization of the system that are diagnostic of interactions among parts of the system at other levels the emergent behaviors or structures are not evident from considering only the system s separate components . This solicitation has been motivated by the observation that many natural social and engineered systems have been recognized to be complex systems in which the traditional reductionist approach to science and engineering fails to predict and explain the patterns and behaviors that emerge from the functioning of these systems . Many engineered systems fall into this category and unexpected failures and other consequences have been experienced as these systems function near the edge of their expected performance capacity for example in power grids traffic systems critical civil infrastructures materials chemical industrial systems manufacturing and service enterprises and environmental systems . Although these unexpected behaviors can be undesirable it has also been recognized that complex systems with their ability to display emergent behaviors can be designed to be resilient and robust features that are desirable in engineered systems . The proposals submitted in response to this solicitation must meet the requirements delineated in this solicitation .,Although these unexpected behaviors can be undesirable it has also been recognized that complex systems with their ability to display emergent behaviors can be designed to be resilient and robust features that are desirable in engineered systems .,"[""systems"",""behaviors"",""solicitation"",""complex"",""system""]"

As computing becomes more important in all sectors of society so does the preparation of a globally competitive U . S . workforce able to apply core computing concepts methods technologies and tools referred to here as Computational Thinking CT to a broad range of societal challenges and opportunities . CT capitalizes on concepts methods technologies and tools fundamental to the fields of computing i . e . computer and information science and engineering . For example computing concepts and methods equip us to reason at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously to think algorithmically and apply foundational mathematical concepts to solve complex problems and to understand the dimensions and consequences of scale . However it is only when computing concepts and methods are combined with the power of automation afforded by contemporary computing technologies and tools that the full potential of CT is unleashed . Drawing deeply on computational concepts methods technologies and tools CT serves as a powerful strategy to more effectively design understand and solve problems associated with complex systems in many aspects of modern life . The CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Education in Computing CPATH program recognizes the growing importance of CT in society . The goals of the program are to contribute to the development of a globally competitive U . S . workforce with CT competencies essential to U . S . leadership in the global innovation enterprise increase the number of students developing CT competencies by infusing CT learning opportunities into undergraduate education in the core computing fields computer and information science and engineering and in other fields of study and demonstrate transformative CT focused undergraduate education models that are replicable across a variety of institutions . Through the CPATH program CISE challenges the academic community to identify and define the core computing concepts methods technologies and tools to be integrated into promising new undergraduate education models and to demonstrate effective strategies to develop and assess CT competencies in the relevant learning communities . While aimed primarily at revitalizing undergraduate education CISE encourages the exploration of new models that extend from institutions of higher education into the K 12 environment activities that engage K 12 teachers and students to facilitate the seamless transition of secondary students into CT focused undergraduate programs are particularly encouraged . Successful CPATH proposals will include administrators researchers educators and students in institutions of higher education . Further the engagement of stakeholders in other types of organizations including but not limited to K 12 schools and school districts industry and professional societies is also encouraged . Every CPATH proposal must demonstrate the engagement of faculty with expertise in the core computer and information science and engineering CISE disciplines . The CPATH program seeks proposals in two size classes Class I projects with project budgets totaling no more than 300 000 for 1 2 or 3 year durations and Class II projects with project budgets totaling no more than 800 000 each for 2 or 3 year durations .,"leadership in the global innovation enterprise increase the number of students developing CT competencies by infusing CT learning opportunities into undergraduate education in the core computing fields computer and information science and engineering and in other fields of study and demonstrate transformative CT focused undergraduate education models that are replicable across a variety of institutions .

NSF s Science Engineering and Education for Sustainability SEES activities aim to address this need through support for interdisciplinary research and education . Coastal SEES is focused on the sustainability of coastal systems . For this solicitation we define coastal systems as the swath of land closely connected to the sea including barrier islands wetlands mudflats beaches estuaries cities towns recreational areas and maritime facilities the continental seas and shelves and the overlying atmosphere . These systems are subject to complex and dynamic interactions among natural and human driven processes . Coastal systems are crucial to regional and national economies hosting valued human built infrastructure and providing ecosystem services that sustain human well being . More than half of the world s human population lived in coastal areas in 2000 and this proportion is predicted to increase to 75 percent by 2025 . Humans benefit from their use of coastal environments for enjoyment dwelling food industry and commerce altering them physically chemically and ecologically . These alterations influence and interact with natural variability extreme events and long term change to affect the system as a whole including human benefits . A major challenge is to understand the dynamics of this coupled human natural system in order to inform societal decisions about the uses of coastal systems including for economic aesthetic recreational research and conservation purposes . Such understanding requires integration of natural social economic and behavioral sciences . It includes for example an understanding of reciprocal feedbacks between humans and the natural environment how people and organizations interpret assess and act upon scientific and other evidence and how they weigh these interpretations against other interests to influence governance and decision making . Thus coastal sustainability relies on broad and intimately interconnected areas of scholarship about natural and human processes .,"Meeting this formidable challenge requires a substantial increase in our understanding of the integrated system of society the natural world and the alterations humans bring to Earth .

Implementation Implementation awards will support development and implementation of technologies addressing a subset of elements of the data preservation and access lifecycle including acquisition documentation security and integrity storage access analysis and dissemination migration and deaccession . These data preservation and access technologies will enable science and engineering research such that the scientific and engineering problems serve as use cases for data technology development . Awards will be up to 5 years in duration . Interoperability Interoperability awards will develop frameworks that provide consistency or commonality of design across communities and implementation for data acquisition management preservation sharing dissemination etc . This includes data and metadata format and content conventions standardized constructs or protocols taxonomies or ontologies . The development of interoperability frameworks through community based mechanisms provides a means for ensuring that existing conventions and practices are appropriately recognized and integrated that implementation is made realistic and feasible and most importantly that the real needs of the community are identified and met . Awards will be up to 3 years in duration . The Office of CyberInfrastucture OCI is partnering with Directorates and Offices across the foundation to support DIBBs a program to develop data infrastructure usable by multiple scientific disciplines recognizing these disciplines may vary in their current state of development .

The goal is to provide an understanding of and predictive capability for marine ecosystem organization and production particularly as the dual drivers of climate variability and fishing pressure affect them . Comparative analyses provide an ideal way to achieve this goal . They can be employed in lieu of direct experimentation where controlled manipulation at relevant temporal and spatial scales is not possible . Well designed comparative studies use existing gradients in ecosystem features to reveal how those features are manifest in processes and structures . Comparative analysis may be applied across ecosystems within ecosystems through time or across modeling approaches . As a partnership initiated in FY2009 between the National Science Foundation NSF and the US Department of Commerce NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service NOAA NMFS CAMEO supported research will focus on basic science to understand ecosystem processes basic research that will ultimately contribute to management of marine species habitats and ecosystems . Central to the program is an emphasis on collaborative partnerships between academic and federal agency scientists .,The goal is to provide an understanding of and predictive capability for marine ecosystem organization and production particularly as the dual drivers of climate variability and fishing pressure affect them .,"[""ecosystems"",""ecosystem"",""marine""]"

The core of the activity is long term research experiences for cohorts of at least six undergraduates . Projects must focus on research topics that require interplay between computation and mathematics or statistics . They should expose students to contemporary mathematics statistics and computation addressed with modern research tools and methods . That is projects must be genuine research experiences rather than rehearsals of research methods . Interdisciplinary projects are encouraged and appropriate mentorship from the disciplines involved is welcomed . In addition we expect that projects will strengthen the research and education capacity infrastructure and culture of the participating institutions . To this end we welcome projects that create models for education in the mathematical sciences and influence the direction of academic programs for a broad range of students . CSUMS is a joint effort of the Education and Human Resources EHR and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences MPS directorates at the National Science Foundation NSF .,Projects must focus on research topics that require interplay between computation and mathematics or statistics .,"[""research"",""students"",""projects"",""computation""]"

Innovation in information technology IT has driven economic growth underlies many of our recent scientific advances and ensures our national security it is not surprising then that predicted IT job growth is very strong . Yet students are not majoring in computing in sufficient numbers .

We cannot meet workforce demands without their participation and we cannot in an increasingly competitive world economy afford to cede the talents and creativity of so many . To ensure their participation and the full participation of all students we must provide better opportunities to study computing in K 12 . We must start with a better understanding of how students learn computing . Unlike many of the other STEM science technology engineering and mathematics disciplines computing has not developed a robust research base on the teaching and learning of its fundamental concepts and skills . That research base must be built and it must be used in providing all students with rigorous academic curricula that cover computational concepts and skills and the breadth of application and potential of computing . Providing access to rigorous academic computing in K 12 will require an unprecedented effort to develop curriculum and materials and to prepare teachers . CE21 thus supports efforts in three tracks Computing Education Research CER proposals will aim to develop a research base for computing education . Projects may conduct basic research on the teaching and learning of computational competencies they may design develop test validate and refine materials measurement tools and methods for teaching in specific contexts and or they may implement promising small scale interventions in order to study their efficacy with particular groups . Efforts can focus on computational thinking as taught in computing courses or infused across the curriculum they can target students or their teachers in informal or formal educational settings or they can address any level within the K 16 pipeline from elementary school through high school and college .

Innovations in computing and more broadly information technology IT drive our economy underlie many new advances in science and engineering and contribute to our national security . Projected job growth in IT is very strong . Despite these very positive indicators student interest in computing has declined dramatically over the last decade . For example the percentage of college freshmen indicating an intent to major in computing has declined overall by 70 in the last decade for women the decline was 80 HERI 2000 2009 . Recent data show that student interest in computing majors has fallen behind projected job openings by a factor of five and a half ACT 2010 . The CE21 program seeks to reverse this troubling trend by engaging larger numbers of students teachers and educators in computing education and learning at earlier stages in the education pipeline . While interventions in primary education are within scope the CE21 program focuses special attention on activities targeted at the middle and high school levels i . e . secondary education and in early undergraduate education . The goals of the CE21 program are to Increase the number and diversity of K 14 students and teachers who develop and practice computational competencies in a variety of contexts and Increase the number and diversity of early postsecondary students who are engaged and have the background in computing necessary to successfully pursue degrees in computing related and computationally intensive fields of study . The program seeks to increase computational competencies for all students regardless of gender race ethnicity disability status or socioeconomic status and regardless too of eventual career choices . By promoting and enhancing computing K 14 education the CE21 program seeks to increase interest in computing as a field in its own right and also to better prepare students for successful careers in other computing intensive fields . All CE21 projects are expected to Contribute to the creation of a rich research base that informs our understanding of effective teaching and learning in computing andDraw on partnerships among the computing and teaching and learning communities institutions of learning including primary secondary and post secondary institutions and organizations and other stakeholders .

STEM C Partnerships combines and advances the efforts of both the former Math and Science Partnership MSP and the former Computing Education for the 21st Century CE21 programs . It is critical that our nation maintain a competent competitive and creative STEM workforce including teachers . Therefore NSF aims to inspire and motivate the next generation of that workforce while ensuring that it has the skills competencies and preparation to be successful . As we transition to a global knowledge based economy that is often driven by information technology and innovation it is increasingly important that STEM workforce preparation includes a strong foundation in computing . Thus the STEM C Partnerships program addresses both the need for advances in K 12 STEM education generally as well as the need to elevate the inclusion of computer science education . From MSP STEM C Partnerships embraces any of the STEM disciplines within the natural sciences mathematics engineering or computer science and maintains its commitment to institutional partnerships and opportunities for funding of Targeted proposals in one of four focal areas Community Enterprise for STEM Teaching and Learning Current Issues Related to STEM Content Identifying and Cultivating Exceptional Talent and K 12 STEM Teacher Preparation . From CE21 STEM C Partnerships adds a discipline specific focal area on the teaching and learning of computing and computational thinking a strong commitment to broadening participation in computing an emphasis on in service teacher professional development and support for the implementation of computer science courses at the high school level . It is expected that the merging of the MSP and CE21 programs will strengthen both and serve as a model for future incorporation of discipline specific concerns into programs focused more broadly on STEM . The STEM C Partnerships program supports Partnerships that promote effective K 12 STEM education building knowledge of teaching and learning in ways that deepen understanding and stimulate further exploration of STEM education in both in and out of school settings . The Partnerships cross disciplinary teams call upon the expertise and research perspectives of learning scientists including cognitive scientists educational developmental and social psychologists social scientists and education researchers as well as STEM discipline specific teachers faculty researchers and scientists . The Partnerships provide the context and environment for the effective preparation professional development and ongoing support of K 12 teachers . Changes at the undergraduate level related to the preparation of K 12 STEM teachers are an implicit expectation of the work in this way the STEM C Partnerships is a K 16 endeavor . Projects are encouraged to look at scalable models of effective learning and professional development mediated perhaps by evolving computational devices and advances in cyberinfrastructure as well as ongoing developments in models resources tools and their applications to learning content delivery and pedagogy . The program supports transformative research and its use by varied research development and implementation communities . The needs of a particular Partnership related to advancing the teaching and learning of any of the STEM disciplines at the K 12 level should drive the focus of the Partnership s work . The inclusion of computer science computational thinking computational science or computing in K 12 STEM instruction is welcome but not required . All STEM C Partnerships projects serve as models that have a sufficiently strong evidence research base to improve STEM education outcomes for all students . The STEM C Partnerships program requires institutional commitment to evidence based teaching and learning which improves the achievement of all students studying STEM with particular attention to educational practices that are effective for groups underrepresented in STEM women minorities African Americans Hispanics Native Americans Alaska Natives Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islander territories and students with disabilities . STEM CP CE21 Through this STEM CP CE21 solicitation NSF seeks to support three types of awards . Broadening Participation and Education in Computing BPEC awards aim to build a rich knowledge base on the effective teaching and learning of computing skills and concepts with particular attention to educational practices that are effective for students from underrepresented groups .

Advancement through successive project phases including the award of a shipyard contract for the construction phase will be contingent upon successful project execution by the Awardee as determined through NSF review and the availability of funds . The actual number of vessels built will be contingent upon projected future science utilization and the availability of funds . NSF will award a single Cooperative Agreement to a Lead Institution LI as the Awardee who will manage each phase of the design construction and trials . Funding for the project will be awarded through Cooperative Support Agreements CSA s for each successive phase as described below . Funding of subsequent phases will be contingent upon successful completion of prior phases . Success will be determined through NSF review at key project milestones in accordance with the NSF Large Facilities Manual . Unsuccessful project execution will result in NSF invoking one of several possible project off ramps followed by solicitation for a new Lead Institution . All support is contingent upon appropriations from Congress and approval by the National Science Foundation as indicated herein . The proposing LI must demonstrate its ability to undertake the successful direction management technical oversight procurement construction scientific outfitting sea trials and post delivery activities of the vessel s as described herein . The proposing LI should demonstrate its ability to leverage planning and construction of the RCRV s to advance academic research support investments in faculty development and graduate undergraduate education and engage in collaborative research . Organizations responding to this program solicitation may at their discretion include a proposal to operate the first RCRV for a period not to exceed five 5 years provided that it shall 1 operate the vessel in the appropriate geographic region based on coastal and near coastal science utilization at the time of delivery and 2 operate the vessel with the highest degree of economic efficiency within that region . The LI should anticipate an external review of operational effectiveness and quality of service after five 5 years of operation and assuming a positive review re competition after ten 10 years of operation . Re competition does not imply that the Operating Institution will be required to change but rather that it will be open for potential change . If the 5 year review is not satisfactory NSF may decide to re compete earlier than 10 years . Selection of Operating Institutions for any additional vessels will be conducted by means of a separate competition that will be completed prior to delivery of the first RCRV . The selected Lead Institution will be allowed to compete for operation of any follow on vessels . The current RCRV design was developed through an interagency agreement with the U . S . Navy s Program Executive Office Ships which produced two competing vessel designs for a 155 multi purpose oceanographic research ship capable of operating for up to 21 days in three distinct regions the U . S . East West and Gulf Coasts . That effort was completed in early 2009 . A panel of experts was convened by NSF later that year to review the designs and recommend the one considered most favorable for further development . During Phase I of the anticipated award the existing design will be re evaluated and refreshed by the Awardee based on 1 current regulatory requirements and 2 recommendations from the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System UNOLS Fleet Improvement Committee FIC as agreed to by NSF . An analysis of the feasibility and costs associated with acquiring and converting an existing vessel to meet the technical operational requirements of the refreshed design shall accompany the analysis of construction costs for a new build RCRV . In accordance with the NSF Large Facilities Manual an in depth Conceptual Design Review CDR will be conducted during Phase I the success of which will determine NSF approval of Awardee progression toward a Preliminary Design Review PDR . A successful PDR will be required to support inclusion of the RCRV Project in a future Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC budget request to Congress . Following successful completion of PDR and NSF approval for inclusion of the RCRV in a future MREFC budget request the LI will manage the shipyard selection process Phase II . This Phase will include in depth NSF review of the proposed Acquisition Strategy . The LI will subsequently manage the entire construction effort Phase III for up to three hulls contingent upon a successful Final Design Review FDR and the availability of funding . For efficiency of production the hull and major machinery of the RCRVs will be identical and the arrangements nearly identical . Slight variations in the science outfitting may be made to suit the requirements of a particular region . The LI will also manage the trials and delivery of all three hulls Phase IV and assist in transition of the vessels to their respective Operating Institutions . The proposal must demonstrate the Lead Institution s past experience in construction conversion maintenance and or management of vessel operations in support of science and education as well as their ability to assemble a qualified team to successfully execute the RCRV project within cost scope and schedule . Following successful completion of Phase IV the selected Operating Institution s will assume responsibility for the management operation and maintenance of the vessel s to support NSF and other federally funded oceanographic research projects . Operational funding for the RCRV s will be reviewed and negotiated annually through five year Cooperative Agreement s with the Ship Operations Program Division of Ocean Sciences . NSF intends that following delivery and turnover of the RCRV s the selected Operating Institution s will obtain University National Oceanographic Laboratory System UNOLS membership See http www . unols . org and the ship s will be scheduled through the UNOLS scheduling process allowing all interested funded scientists equal access to the facility .

In this context the solicitation is one element of the NSF wide Risk and Resilience activity with the overarching goal of advancing knowledge in support of improvement of the nation s infrastructure resilience . The devastating effects of recent disasters such as Hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria have underscored that a great deal remains to be done . In addition CRISP 2 . 0 is aligned with the NSF wide frontier thinking on convergence characterized as deep integration of knowledge techniques and expertise from multiple fields to form new and expanded frameworks for addressing scientific and societal challenges and opportunities . The Directorate of Engineering and the Directorate of Social Behavioral and Economic Sciences therefore jointly invest in the CRISP 2 . 0 solicitation to stimulate the integration of engineering and social behavioral and economic sciences to foster new paradigms and domains in interdependent critical infrastructures . Critical infrastructures are the mainstay of our nation s economy security and well being . They provide essential services through systems and processes . Many of the critical infrastructures are interconnected and even interdependent . This solicitation calls for integrated research on Interdependent Critical Infrastructures ICIs by interdisciplinary teams of engineers and social behavioral and economic scientists . Research funded through this program is expected to provide the momentum to create a new science of integrative designs in ICIs to stimulate economic growth and to inform how communities can engage diverse resources to improve the quality of life for their inhabitants . Infrastructures are networks of systems and processes that function cooperatively and synergistically to produce and distribute a continuous flow of essential goods and services . For this competition two or more infrastructures are said to be interdependent if they require each other s services or if the processes by which they deliver services can be affected by each other . The goals of the Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes 2 . 0 CRISP 2 . 0 solicitation are to 1 foster an interdisciplinary research community of engineers and social behavioral and economic SBE scientists who work synergistically together for innovation in the design and management of infrastructures as processes and services 2 transform relevant fields by re thinking ICIs as processes and services that may have complementary and or substitutional roles with each other 3 create innovations in ICIs that contribute directly and positively to people s quality of life spur economic growth and respond to both internal perturbations and external shocks regardless of whether they are natural technological or human induced . These goals lead to the following specific objectives for this solicitation To generate new knowledge approaches and solutions to resilience and improve the capability of existing and future ICIs to respond to internal and external changes To create innovative theoretical frameworks and multidisciplinary models of ICIs processes and services capable of modeling monitoring and predicting complex behaviors and outcomes in response to both internal and external shocks To develop integrative frameworks to understand interdependencies among ICIs and leverage them to enhance the processes and services that ICIs provide To study socioeconomic cultural political legal and psychological and other obstacles to improving ICIs and to identify strategies for overcoming these obstacles andTo support the creation curation and use of publicly accessible data on infrastructure systems and processes whether in the context of explanation prediction or modeling .

Earth observations are a critical ingredient for understanding and predicting the sustainability or disruption of natural services that support basic human needs including water food energy mineral resources and safe habitation . Such observations are collected by seismic networks atmospheric and ocean based sensors detecting e . g . ozone greenhouse gases ocean currents sea ice extent river and tide gauges and satellites that observe changing terrestrial features including receding glaciers growth of deserts and urban centers and evolving vegetative covers . One pressing challenge is to develop terrestrial observatories that could document and inform prediction of the multi scale and less visible transport of energy and material and evolution of the Earth s critical zone . This zone the thin veneer of Earth that extends from the top of the vegetation to the base of weathered bedrock is critical because it is where fresh water flows soils are formed from rocks and terrestrial life flourishes . This zone provides most of the ecosystem services on which societies depend . Its intrinsic resilience natural evolution and fate in the face of human land use and climate change needs to be understood and predicted in order to inform our strategies for sustaining a wide range of human activities . Unprecedented pressures are being placed on the critical zone and understanding the interrelated processes system dynamics sensitivities and thresholds in this zone is of vital importance for informing human decisions . NSF seeks proposals to establish a networked set of Critical Zone Observatories CZOs that will address pressing interdisciplinary scientific questions concerning geological physical chemical and biological processes and their couplings that govern critical zone system dynamics . The CZOs are expected collectively to 1 measure and quantify the significant processes of the critical zone on appropriate time and space scales 2 develop a unifying theoretical framework that integrates new understanding of coupled hydrological geochemical geomorphological sedimentological and biological processes and 3 develop couple and validate system level models to predict how the critical zone responds to external forces such as anthropogenic climatic and or tectonic processes . Each observatory must contribute to strengthening the scientific basis for decision making particularly with regards to impacts on health safety and environment due to observed and predicted changes in the critical zone . An overarching goal of the critical zone observatory network which will be comprised of US based sites 50 states plus territories is to offer scalable and transferable information that could enhance the scale and scope of the knowledge building and societal benefits that will accrue beyond where the specific CZOs are located . Amongst the strategies contemplated in this program are diversifying the coverage of observatories in terms of geography geology and types of environments leveraging existing infrastructure and legacy data coordinating observations data management modeling and educational activities among CZOs and coordinating activities that address common questions at multiple observatories . All CZOs will be expected to collect a common set of measurements in addition to site specific measurements describing the geological physical chemical hydrological and biological characteristics of the site . In addition it is anticipated that the CZOs will adhere to common data management policy and use common data management tools . The network of CZOs will additionally serve as a community resource to engage investigators beyond the CZO awardees in critical zone research .,"Earth observations are a critical ingredient for understanding and predicting the sustainability or disruption of natural services that support basic human needs including water food energy mineral resources and safe habitation .

Currently the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility AMGRF at Florida State University is fulfilling this role . The AMGRF was established in 1963 and is housed in a single story 10 000 sq . ft . building on the Florida State University campus . This facility consists of a 6000 sq . ft . cold room 34 F a walk in freezer 27 F and office and lab space . AMGRF houses approximately 21 400 meters of marine sediment and drill cores collected from over 90 United States Antarctic Program USAP research cruises . Approximately 5 300 meters of core are stored in core boxes 6 000 meters of piston cores are stored in plastic sleeves in sections up to 3 . 5 meters long 600 meters of core are stored in various other containers and approximately 10 500 meters are stored in D tubes . Less than 100 meters of core is stored at 20 F . In addition the AMGRF has an estimated 5000 bags of samples from grab samples and core catchers . Florida State University has been an effective steward of these marine cores for many years but the University has recently notified NSF that continued operation of the AMGRF is no longer central to the long term vision of the University . Consequently this solicitation seeks a qualified organization to provide core curation services for geological cores collected in the polar regions . The award will be administered as a Cooperative Agreement and will cover a five year operating period beginning October 1 2017 . A programmatic review will be held prior to the completion of the initial period of support and the results will guide the decision whether to renew the Cooperative Agreement for another five year period .,"Currently the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility AMGRF at Florida State University is fulfilling this role .

New smart CPS will drive innovation and competition in sectors such as agriculture energy transportation building design and automation healthcare and manufacturing . The December 2010 report of the President s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology PCAST titled Designing a Digital Future Federally Funded Research and Development in Networking and Information Technology calls for continued investment in CPS research because of its scientific and technological importance as well as its potential impact on grand challenges in a number of sectors critical to U .

These challenges and technology gaps are further described in a CPS Vision Statement published in 2012 by the federal Networking and Information Technology Research and Development NITRD CPS Senior Steering Group . Tremendous progress has been made in advancing CPS technology over the last five plus years . We have explored foundational technologies that have spanned an ever growing set of application domains enabling breakthrough achievements in many of these fields . At the same time the demand for innovation in these domains continues to grow and is driving the need to accelerate fundamental research to keep pace . Despite significant inroads into CPS technology in recent years we do not yet have a mature science to support systems engineering of high confidence CPS and the consequences are profound . Traditional analysis tools are unable to cope with the full complexity of CPS or adequately predict system behavior . For example minor events that trip the current electric power grid an ad hoc system can escalate with surprising speed into widespread power failures . This scenario exemplifies the lack of appropriate science and technology to conceptualize and design for the deep interdependencies among engineered systems and the natural world . The challenges and opportunities for CPS are thus significant and far reaching . New relationships between the cyber and physical components require new architectural models that redefine form and function . They integrate the continuous and discrete compounded by the uncertainty of open environments . Traditional real time performance guarantees are insufficient for CPS when systems are large and spatially temporally or hierarchically distributed in configurations that may rapidly change . With the greater autonomy and cooperation possible with CPS greater assurances of safety security scalability and reliability are demanded placing a high premium on open interfaces modularity interoperability and verification . The goal of the CPS program is to develop the core system science needed to engineer complex cyber physical systems which people can use or interact with and depend upon . Some of these may require high confidence or provable behaviors . The program aims to foster a research community committed to advancing research and education in CPS and to transitioning CPS science and technology into engineering practice . By abstracting from the particulars of specific systems and application domains the CPS program seeks to reveal cross cutting fundamental scientific and engineering principles that underpin the integration of cyber and physical elements across all application sectors . To expedite and accelerate the realization of cyber physical systems in a wide range of applications the CPS program also supports the development of methods tools and hardware and software components based upon these cross cutting principles along with validation of the principles via prototypes and testbeds . We have also seen a convergence of CPS technologies and research thrusts that underpin Smart Cities and the Internet of Things IoT .

This triad of approaches is used by scientists and engineers to analyze the characteristics and predict the behavior of complex systems and the applications that represent them . However accurate and comprehensive analysis and prediction of the behavior of complex systems over time is difficult . With traditional simulation and measurement approaches even elaborate computational models of such systems produce applications and simulations that diverge from or fail to predict real system behaviors . This solicitation focuses explicitly on Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems DDDAS a promising concept in which the computational and experimental measurement aspects of a computing application are dynamically integrated creating new capabilities in a wide range of science and engineering application areas . Computational aspects of DDDAS may be realized on a diverse set of computer platforms including computational grids leadership class supercomputers mid range clusters distributed high throughput computing environments high end workstations and sensor networks . Consequently DDDAS funded projects are expected to make significant contributions to research advances in computational science and engineering high end computing measurement methods and cyberinfrastructure . DDDAS is a paradigm whereby application simulations and measurements become a symbiotic feedback control system . DDDAS entails the ability to dynamically incorporate additional data into an executing application and in reverse the ability of an application to dynamically steer the measurement process . Such capabilities promise more accurate analysis and prediction more precise controls and more reliable outcomes . The ability of an application simulation to control and guide the measurement process and determine when where and how it is best to gather additional data has itself the potential of enabling more effective measurement methodologies . Furthermore the incorporation of dynamic inputs into an executing application invokes new system modalities and helps create application software systems that can more accurately describe real world complex systems . This enables the development of applications that adapt intelligently to evolving conditions and that infer new knowledge in ways that are not predetermined by startup parameters . The need for such dynamic applications is already emerging in business engineering and scientific processes analysis and design . Manufacturing process controls resource management weather and climate prediction traffic management systems engineering civil engineering geo exploration social and behavioral modeling cognitive measurement and bio sensing are examples of areas likely to benefit from DDDAS . DDDAS creates a rich set of new challenges for applications algorithms systems software and measurement methods . The research scope described here requires strong systematic collaborations between applications domain researchers and mathematics statistics and computer sciences researchers as well as researchers involved in the design and implementation of measurement methods and instruments . Consequently most projects proposed in response to this solicitation are expected to involve teams of researchers . Following merit review of the proposals received projects will be selected for support by NSF the National Institutes of Health NIH and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA .,"This solicitation focuses explicitly on Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems DDDAS a promising concept in which the computational and experimental measurement aspects of a computing application are dynamically integrated creating new capabilities in a wide range of science and engineering application areas .

Accordingly DMREF will support activities that significantly accelerate materials discovery and or development by building the fundamental knowledge base needed to design and make materials and or devices with specific and desired functions or properties .
This will be accomplished through forming interdisciplinary teams of researchers working synergistically in a closed loop fashion building a vibrant research community leveraging data science providing ready access to materials data and educating the future MGI workforce .
Computational efforts will begin at the smallest appropriate length scale such as electronic atomic molecular nano micro and meso scale appropriately informed by data or models to provide predictive or fundamental insight that will work effectively in concert with data centric experimental and theoretical efforts to discover new materials new states of matter or advance understanding of materials properties and phenomena and their control through structure applied fields or other means .","[""materials"",""data""]"

Advances in recent decades have elucidated how individual elements of the nervous system and brain relate to specific behaviors and cognitive processes . However there remains much to discover to attain a comprehensive understanding of how the healthy brain functions specifically the general principles underlying how cognition and behavior relate to the brain s structural organization and dynamic activities how the brain interacts with its environment and how brains maintain their functionality over time . Achieving an understanding of brain structure and function that spans levels of organization spatial and temporal scales and the diversity of species requires an international transdisciplinary collaborative effort to not only integrate discipline specific ideas and approaches but also extend them to stimulate new discoveries and innovative concepts theories and methodologies . The objective of this phase of the NeuroNex Program is the establishment of distributed international research networks that build on existing global investments in neurotechnologies to address overarching questions in neuroscience .

The coastal BBL is a defining characteristic of coastal ecosystems and yet is among the most understudied components of the coastal environment . In part a more detailed understanding of the BBL has been hindered by the inability to directly observe BBL processes that occur at a wide range of temporal scales and may have characteristic controlling thresholds . Furthermore the BBL is not observable via most remote sensing technologies such as satellite and aircraft mounted sensor systems and shore based HF radar arrays which focus on the sea surface . The strategy adopted here is that intellectual and applied technological advances proceed most effectively when they occur in concert . This solicitation therefore requires a particular focus on both the development of technologies and the conduct of research that will improve understanding of BBL processes . To accomplish this goal one or more pilot testbed study sites will be established . Successful proposals will demonstrate a plan that leads to advances in understanding of BBL processes through advances in sensors instruments platforms and power and or communications technologies for use in coastal observing research . The development and enhancement of new and existing technologies are needed to investigate coastal processes at appropriate temporal and spatial scales . The scientific rationale for the focus on coastal benthic exchange dynamics has been outlined at a community workshop and in a subsequent report Reimers et al . 2004 on benthic boundary layer processes organized by the NSF s Division of Ocean Sciences Coastal Ocean Processes CoOP Program .,"The goal of this solicitation is to advance interactive observing technologies and understanding of the coastal benthic boundary layer BBL defined here as the portion of the water column and surface sediments impacted by the presence of the sediment water interface .

For this solicitation we define coastal systems as the swath of land closely connected to the sea including barrier islands wetlands mudflats beaches estuaries cities towns recreational areas and maritime facilities the continental seas and shelves and the overlying atmosphere . Humans benefit from their use of coastal environments for enjoyment dwelling food industry and commerce and benefit from the myriad of ecosystem services that coastal environments provide . However human activities often result in physical chemical and ecological alterations that influence and interact with natural state and variability over a range of spatial and temporal scales . A major challenge is to understand the dynamics of this coupled human natural system in order to inform societal decisions about the uses of coastal systems including for economic aesthetic recreational research and conservation purposes . Scientific understanding is foundational and must include an understanding of reciprocal feedbacks between humans and the natural environment how people and organizations interpret assess and act upon scientific and other evidence and how they weigh these interpretations against other interests to influence governance and decision making . Thus coastal sustainability relies on broad and intimately interconnected areas of scholarship about natural and human processes . Coastal SEES projects will be expected to lead to generalizable theoretical advances in natural sciences and engineering while at the same time integrating key aspects of human processes required to address issues of coastal sustainability .,A major challenge is to understand the dynamics of this coupled human natural system in order to inform societal decisions about the uses of coastal systems including for economic aesthetic recreational research and conservation purposes .,"[""coastal"",""natural"",""human""]"

The GSS has provided data on contemporary American society since 1972 serving as a barometer of social change and trends in attitudes behaviors and attributes of the United States adult population . In 1984 the GSS stimulated cross national research by collaborating with Australia Britain and Germany to develop data collection programs modeled on the GSS . This program of comparative cross national research called the International Social Survey Program ISSP now includes 43 nations and enables researchers and analysts to place findings and trends from the United States within a comparative perspective . Since its inception the GSS has completed 26 in person cross sectional surveys of the adult household population of the United States with response rates that exceed 70 percent . The survey is currently fielded biennially . Data from the GSS are made available to scholars students and the public for research analysis and educational activities within 12 months of data collection . The 2006 GSS initiated two innovations that shape the conduct of future surveys . First it gathered the baseline sample for a GSS panel component with a sub sample of cases to be re interviewed in 2008 2010 and 2012 . Second the GSS core questions items that appear regularly on surveys were translated into Spanish and administered in either English or Spanish as needed beginning with the 2006 administration . It is anticipated that this practice will continue in future surveys . The Sociology Program in the Directorate for Social Behavioral and Economic Sciences expects to make one award for the next four year funding cycle fiscal years 2009 2012 to support the 2010 and 2012 GSS and the U . S . component of the ISSP survey . We anticipate that NSF will award in the range of 10 million and at most 15 million over four years approximately 2 . 5 million but not more than 3 . 75 million per year to support two waves of data collection and dissemination activities .

Although continental margins have been traditionally assigned to three distinct tectonic settings i . e . convergent divergent and translational the approach used by the MARGINS program recognizes that a range of fundamental physical and chemical processes that form and deform the surface of the Earth operate at all margins . Tectonic setting may govern the specific expression of a particular process that may vary in different environments . However a relatively small number of processes i . e . lithospheric deformation magmatism other mass energy fluxes sedimentation and fluid flow are fundamental to the evolution of the margins . Study of these basic processes wherever they are best expressed provides a more logical line of inquiry for understanding the complex nature of continental margins . This process oriented approach to understanding the entire system of margin evolution requires broadly based interdisciplinary studies and a new class of major experiments . The MARGINS science plan developed from a series of well attended workshops over the past decade advocates concentration on several study areas focus sites targeted for intensive multidisciplinary programs of research in which interaction between field experimentalists numerical modelers and laboratory analysts would occur . MARGINS fosters the involvement of a broad cross section of investigators in focused multidisciplinary experiments at these focus sites to achieve the objectives that could not be accomplished otherwise .

To accomplish these goals requires advanced computational capabilities within the context of a multilevelcomprehensive and innovative infrastructure that benefits all fields of science and engineering . Previous solicitations have concentrated onenabling petascale capability through the deployment and support of a world class High Performance Computing HPC environment . In the pastdecade the NSF has provided the open science and engineering community with a number of state of the art HPC assets ranging from looselycoupled clusters to large scale instruments with many thousands of computing cores communicating via fast interconnects and more recentlywith diverse heterogeneous architectures . Recent developments in computational science have begun to focus on complex dynamic and diverseworkflows . Some of these involve applications that are extremely data intensive and may not be dominated by floating point operation speed . While a number of the earlier acquisitions have addressed a subset of these issues the current solicitation emphasizes this even further . Currently the NSF operates through Blue Waters and the eXtreme Digital XD program a two tiered comprehensive distributedCyberinfrastructure CI and one of the largest and most powerful in the world . Through these and related projects the open science andengineering community is currently capable of tackling many of the most challenging scientific problems across multiple science andengineering domains . Both of these tiers are explicitly designed to address needs beyond the campus level . With this solicitation NSF intends to continue this model to broaden the CI capabilities above the campus level . The resources funded under this solicitation willbe incorporated into and allocated as part of the XD tier of national shared resources . The XD tier currently consistof The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment XSEDE Responsible for integration of XD tier shared resources and services Technical Insertion Service Evaluates and makesrecommendations on insertion of software and other technologies into the XD environmentTechnical Audit Service Provides metricson XD systems and operates XDMoD a publically available and easily usable tool for extractingdata and monitoring XD systems Two visualization resources Longhorn TACC and RDAV NICS University of Tennessee The current solicitation requests innovative proposal of two types The first is intended to complement previous NSF investments in advanced computationalinfrastructure . Consistent with the ACI Strategic Plan the current solicitation is focused on expanding the use of high end resources to amuch larger and more diverse community . To quote from the ACI Strategic Plan the goal is to . . . position and support the entirespectrum of NSF funded communities . . . . and to promote a more comprehensive and balanced portfolio . . . . to support multidisciplinarycomputational and data enabled science and engineering that in turn supports the entire scientific engineering and educationalcommunity . Thus while continuing to provide essential and needed resources to the more traditional users of HPC it is important toenlarge the horizon to include research communities that are not users of traditional HPC systems but who would benefit from advancedcomputational capabilities at the national level . Building testing and deploying these resources within the collaborative ecosystem thatencompasses national regional and campus resources continues to remain a high priority for the NSF and one of increasing importance to thescience and engineering community . The second type is devoted to the increasing pressure on the existing infrastructure to store andprocess very large amounts of data coming from simulation and from experimental resources such as telescopes genome data banks or sensors . As recently stated in BIGDATA NSF 12 499 Pervasive sensing andcomputing across natural built and social environments is generating heterogeneous data at unprecedented scale and complexity . Today scientists biomedical researchers engineers educators citizens and decision makers live in an era of observation data come from manydisparate sources such as sensor networks scientific instruments such as medical equipment telescopes colliders satellites environmental networks and scanners video audio and click streams financial transaction data email weblogs twitter feeds andpicture archives spatial graphs and maps and scientific simulations and models . This plethora of data sources has given rise to aphenomenal diversity in data types data can be temporal spatial or dynamic and can be derived from both structured and unstructuredsources . Data may have different representation types media formats and levels of granularity and may be used across multiple scientificdisciplines . These new sources of data and their increasing complexity contribute to an explosion of information . A criticalaspect of the cyberinfrastructure required to deal with this data deluge is that the data must be rapidly available to researchersgeographically separated from where those data resources are located . In addition it is important to ensure that the data is secure . Toaddress this need the current solicitation is designed to complement these other solicitations and calls for the acquisition and support ofa large scale instrument that will have the capability of storing sustainably accessing analyzing disseminating securing and migratingdata across the NSF cyberinfrastructure . The data may come from scientific computation from scientific instruments sensors or other sourcesbut once it is generated it often needs to be available to the scientific community independent of where they are located . One final point this solicitation is not designed to address very long term archival storage issues but proposals that can inform future policy on thisissue say via some use cases are certainly welcome . Service Providers those organizations willing to acquire deploy andoperate ACI resources in service to the science and engineering research and education community play a key role in the provision andsupport of a national Cyberinfrasructure . With this solicitation the NSF requests proposals from organizations willing to serve as ServiceProviders within the eXtreme Digital XD program who propose to acquire and deploy new innovative systems features and services to thescience engineering community using the shared services model of the XSEDE project . Note thatproposals to add new and innovative features to currently deployed systems are eligible for consideration provided they are consistent withthe goals of the current solicitation . Competitive proposals should address one or more of the following Complementexisting XD capabilities with new types of computational resources attuned to less traditional computational sciencecommunities Incorporate innovative and reliable services within the HPC environment to deal with complex and dynamicworkflows that contribute significantly to the advancement of science and are difficult to achieve within XD Facilitatetransition from local to national environments via the use of virtual machines Introduce highly useable and cost efficientcloud computing capabilities into XD to meet national scale requirements for new modes of computationally intensive scientific research Expand the range of data intensive and or computationally challenging science and engineering applications that can betackled with current XD resources Provide reliable approaches to scientific communities needing a high throughputcapability Provide a useful interactive environment for users needing to develop and debug codes using hundreds of coresor for scientific workflows gateways requiring highly responsive computation Deal effectively with scientificapplications needing a few hundred to a few thousand cores Efficiently provide a high degree of stability and usability byJanuary 2015 In past solicitations benchmarks have played an important role . Two types of benchmarks were required NSFprovided and proposer selected benchmarks . For this solicitation the NSF has opted not to require a specific set of NSF providedbenchmarks . One reason for this decision is that the current solicitation is not focused on funding a single large resource designed toserve tightly coupled scientific applications dominated by floating point operations and needing many thousands of cores . While this isstill important in certain contexts the present call is much broader . As such we expect that each proposer will provide a convincingdemonstration with hard data that their system will perform as described in their proposal . The demonstration certainly can addressapplications that are used by the NSF computational science community but should provide compelling evidence of the expanded scientificdiversity resulting from innovative aspects of the proposed resource .

Worst case computational complexity analysis so prevalent in computer science is a form of game theoretic analysis perhaps not surprising considering that one of the founders of game theory John von Neumann was also a pioneering figure in computer science . Game theory is widely used in social and economic science . Social and economic scientists use concepts that are linked to computer science . For example decision scientists and economists consider the bounded rationality of individuals making economic decisions one aspect of bounded rationality is that economic agents may be limited by their computational resources for example in evaluating complicated strategic situations . The ubiquity of socio technical networks has led to new more intimate ties between these two fields . New kinds of interactions and transactions have been enabled by such networks . Key features of these new transactions include parties who do not know or trust each otherparties represented by software agentsreal time adaptation decision making and chain reactions by agentsDesigning decision mechanisms that can govern these increasingly important types of transactions in ways that meet criteria such as fairness revenue maximization or efficent resource use is a challenge that requires the expertise of both social and economic scientists and computer scientists . Internet traffic as also physical traffic on our road networks email the use of network bandwidth the allocation of computing resources to competing processes etc . may be managed using economic and social choice mechanisms to achieve better utilization and reduction of the nuisance and harm caused by intruders and spammers . Good incentive mechanisms are also needed to mediate the interactions among infrastructure providers service providers and clients for computing and communication infrastructure . Mechanisms are also important in driving multi agent software systems towards socially desirable goals . These questions may require a new understanding of simultaneous collaboration and competition among economic agents . Computational thinking has the potential to change the types of questions considered by social and economic scientists . For example Nash and other equilibria lie at the heart of theories about the behavior of economic agents . Computational thinking can help characterize the range and robustness of possible equilibria and markets for which the computation of equilibria is intractable . Theories of strategic learning by computational agents studied both in economics and computer science can shed light on the dynamics of how agents arrive at equilibria . Theories of the spread of contagion or gossip in networks can help explain and contain the chain reactions that can arise . Social behavioral economic and computer scientists can jointly study the dynamic functioning and evolution of social and economic networks with mutual benefit to both fields of study . Some important examples of such systems are recommender systems voting systems and reputation management systems . This program seeks innovative research at this interdisciplinary boundary including both projects that use computational thinking for economic and social decision problems and or ideas from economics and other social sciences for computing and communication systems and multi agents systems . Computational economics research involving simulation and modeling of economic systems is not appropriate for this program .

Professional Formation of Engineers PFE refers to the formal and informal processes and value systems by which people become engineers . It also includes the ethical responsibility of practicing engineers to sustain and grow the profession . The engineering profession must be responsive to national priorities grand challenges and dynamic workforce needs it must be equally open and accessible to all . In FY 2015 the PFE initiative in ENG is launching a pilot program aligned with the IUSE framework Revolutionizing Engineering Departments herein referred to as RED in partnership with the Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE and Education and Human Resources EHR . This funding opportunity enables engineering departments to lead the nation by successfully achieving significant sustainable changes necessary to overcome long standing issues in their undergraduate programs and educate inclusive communities of engineering students prepared to solve 21st century challenges . Computer science departments whether administratively located in or outside an engineering program are included in RED as they share the same challenges as traditional engineering departments . Note Engineering departments in this solicitation will refer to engineering and computer science departments . Even as demographic and regional socio economic factors affect departments in unique ways there are certain tenets of sustainable change that are common across institutions . For instance the development and engagement of the entire faculty within a department are paramount to the process and they must be incentivized . Departmental cultural barriers to inclusion of students and faculty from different backgrounds must be identified and addressed . Finally coherent technical and professional threads must be developed and woven across the four years especially 1 in the core technical courses of the middle two years 2 in internship opportunities in the private and public sectors and 3 in research opportunities with faculty .

New imaging technologies advances in genetic testing and innovations in wearable and or ambient sensors are allowing researchers to predict health outcomes and develop personalized treatments or interventions . Coupled with the rapid growth in computing and infrastructure researchers now have the ability to collect store and analyze vast amounts of health and disease related data from biological biomedical behavioral social environmental and clinical studies . The explosion in the availability of biomedical big data from disparate sources and the complex data structures including images networks and graphs pose significant challenges in terms of visualization modeling and analysis . While there have been some encouraging developments related to foundational mathematical statistical and computational approaches for big data challenges over the past decade there have been relatively few opportunities for collaboration on challenges related to biomedical data science . The National Science Foundation NSF and the National Institutes of Health NIH recognize that fundamental questions in basic clinical and translational research could benefit greatly from multidisciplinary approaches that involve experts in quantitative disciplines such as mathematics statistics and computer science . The Quantitative Approaches to Biomedical Big Data Program is designed to support research that addresses important application areas at the intersection of the biomedical and data sciences by encouraging inter and multi disciplinary collaborations that focus on innovative and transformative approaches to address these challenges .,While there have been some encouraging developments related to foundational mathematical statistical and computational approaches for big data challenges over the past decade there have been relatively few opportunities for collaboration on challenges related to biomedical data science .,"[""biomedical"",""data"",""he"",""challenges"",""researchers""]"

Although continental margins have been traditionally assigned to three distinct tectonic settings i . e . convergent divergent and translational the approach used by the MARGINS program recognizes that a range of fundamental physical and chemical processes that form and deform the surface of the Earth operate at all margins . Tectonic setting may govern the specific expression of a particular process that may vary in different environments . However a relatively small number of processes i . e . lithospheric deformation magmatism other mass energy fluxes sedimentation and fluid flow are fundamental to the evolution of the margins . Study of these basic processes wherever they are best expressed provides a more logical line of inquiry for understanding the complex nature of continental margins . This process oriented approach to understanding the entire system of margin evolution requires broadly based interdisciplinary studies and a new class of major experiments . The MARGINS science plan developed from a series of well attended workshops over the past decade advocates concentration on several study areas focus sites targeted for intensive multidisciplinary programs of research in which interaction between field experimentalists numerical modelers and laboratory analysts would occur . MARGINS fosters the involvement of a broad cross section of investigators in focused multidisciplinary experiments at these focus sites to achieve the objectives that could not be accomplished otherwise .

The in house research conducted by a MIP is transformational and focuses on a targeted materials grand challenge and or a technological outcome e . g . understanding complexity discovery of new phenomena and materials etc . that addresses a national priority . MIPs push the frontiers in materials research by advancing the capabilities of current state of the art experimental tools through the development of new techniques and the next generation of instrumentation that will lead to understanding and discovering new phenomena as well as the discovery of complex functional material systems . In addition it is expected that open access to these cutting edge tools will strengthen collaborations among scientists and enable researchers to work in new ways while fostering new modalities of multidisciplinary education and training . The user facility aspect of a Platform accounts for approximately 50 of the collaborative effort where a MIP provides access to unique high quality state of the art instrumentation and technological services through a staff of experts that are accessible to external researchers and all types of institutions . Due to this convergence of expertise MIPs will serve as focal points that promote cross fertilization of ideas between internal and external researchers . The Platform the tools and techniques developed and the resulting new materials are themselves meant to be transformative . The US once a global leader in materials synthesis has fallen behind in the science of crystal growth . To rebuild technical strength in this area the initial MIPs will focus on developing new bulk and thin film crystalline hard materials . The scientific focus of the MIP program is subject to change from competition to competition . MIPs are anticipated to be five year awards totaling 10 000 000 to 25 000 000 for the award period . MIP awards are eligible for a one time five year renewal subsequent to a rigorous and favorable review by NSF . To cover the breadth of this endeavor it is expected that proposed projects will be directed by a team of at least three Senior Personnel with complementary expertise . Equipment acquisition is expected in the first few years but yearly budget should not exceed 7 . 0M .,"The Division of Materials Research DMR seeks to significantly accelerate advances in materials research and engineering through the rapid discovery of new materials and phenomena by developing a new midscale user facility program Materials Innovation Platforms MIP program .

MIPs respond to the increasing complexity of materials research that requires close collaboration of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teams and access to cutting edge tools . These tools in a user facility benefit both a user program and in house research which focus on addressing grand challenges of fundamental science and meet national needs . MIPs embrace the paradigm set forth by the Materials Genome Initiative MGI which strives to discover manufacture and deploy advanced materials twice as fast at a fraction of the cost and conduct research through iterative closed loop efforts among the areas of materials synthesis processing materials characterization and theory modeling simulation . In addition they are expected to engage the emerging field of data science in materials research . Each MIP is a scientific ecosystem which includes in house research scientists external users and other contributors who collectively form a community of practitioners and share tools codes samples data and know how . The knowledge sharing is designed to strengthen collaborations among scientists and enable them to work in new ways fostering new modalities of research and education training for the purpose of accelerating discovery and development of new materials and novel materials phenomena properties as well as fostering their eventual deployment . The scientific focus of the MIP program is subject to change from competition to competition .

STEM C Partnerships combines and advances the efforts of both the former Math and Science Partnership MSP and the former Computing Education for the 21st Century CE21 programs . It is critical that our nation maintain a competent competitive and creative STEM workforce including teachers . Therefore NSF aims to inspire and motivate the next generation of that workforce while ensuring that it has the skills competencies and preparation to be successful . As we transition to a global knowledge based economy that is often driven by information technology and innovation it is increasingly important that STEM workforce preparation includes a strong foundation in computing . Thus the STEM C Partnerships program addresses both the need for advances in K 12 STEM education generally as well as the need to elevate the inclusion of computer science education . From MSP STEM C Partnerships embraces any of the STEM disciplines within the natural science mathematics engineering or computer science and maintains its commitment to institutional partnerships and opportunities for funding of Targeted proposals in one of four focal areas Community Enterprise for STEM Teaching and Learning Current Issues Related to STEM Content Identifying and Cultivating Exceptional Talent and K 12 STEM Teacher Preparation . From CE21 STEM C Partnerships adds a discipline specific focal area on the teaching and learning of computing and computational thinking a strong commitment to broadening participation in computing an emphasis on in service teacher professional development and support for the implementation of computer science courses at the high school level . It is expected that the merging of the MSP and CE21 programs will strengthen both and serve as a model for future incorporation of discipline specific concerns into programs focused more broadly on STEM . The STEM C Partnerships program supports Partnerships that promote effective K 12 STEM education building knowledge of teaching and learning in ways that deepen understanding and stimulate further exploration of STEM education in both in and out of school settings . The Partnerships cross disciplinary teams call upon the expertise and research perspectives of learning scientists including cognitive scientists educational developmental and social psychologists social scientists and education researchers as well as STEM discipline specific teachers faculty researchers and scientists . The Partnerships provide the context and environment for the effective preparation professional development and ongoing support of K 12 teachers . Changes at the undergraduate level related to the preparation of K 12 STEM teachers are an implicit expectation of the work in this way the STEM C Partnerships is a K 16 endeavor . Projects are encouraged to look at scalable models of effective learning and professional development mediated perhaps by evolving computational devices and advances in cyberinfrastructure as well as ongoing developments in models resources tools and their applications to learning content delivery and pedagogy . The program supports transformative research and its use by varied research development and implementation communities . The needs of a particular Partnership related to advancing the teaching and learning of any of the STEM disciplines at the K 12 level should drive the focus of the Partnership s work . The inclusion of computer science computational thinking computational science or computing in K 12 STEM instruction is welcome but not required . All STEM C Partnerships projects serve as models that have a sufficiently strong evidence research base to improve STEM education outcomes for all students . The STEM C Partnerships program requires institutional commitment to evidence based teaching and learning which improves the achievement of all students studying STEM with particular attention to educational practices that are effective for groups underrepresented in STEM women minorities African Americans Hispanics Native Americans Alaska Natives Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islander territories and students with disabilities .

The value of these three projects depends in part on data accessibility and ease of use . These data dissemination activities provide value far beyond the original data collection effort . That value consists of providing access and tools that enable dissemination to a wide range of user communities from social scientists to advance knowledge and test theories to teachers in secondary schools to explain basic statistical and analytic methods to citizens outside of the higher education and research communities who use the data to generate basic descriptive statistics and graphs . The ANES is a 60 year time series of survey data collections that began in 1948 . The ANES conducts national surveys of the American electorate during election years as well as conducts research and development work through pilot studies . The ANES is considered the gold standard data source for election studies it sheds light on how American democracy works by exploring the causes and consequences of citizen opinion vote choices and electoral outcomes . The GSS has provided data on contemporary American society since 1972 serving as a barometer of social change and trends in attitudes behaviors and attributes of the United States adult population . The GSS is a nationally representative personal interview survey of the United States adult population that collects data on a wide range of behavioral items personal psychological evaluations and demographic characteristics of respondents and their parents . Lastly the PSID is a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of US families that began in 1968 . The PSID is the world s longest running nationally representative panel survey . With over forty years of data on the same families and their descendents the PSID is considered a cornerstone of the data infrastructure for empirically based social science research in the US and the world . Over the course of the extensive survey cycles the three survey projects have accumulated important metadata or data about data including technical reports survey instruments and other information that describe the survey process . These metadata exist in many different formats text and non text based and have been stored in different ways depending on the date of the original data collection the available technologies at that date paper scanned into PDF and other formats and access to storage facilities . Currently these metadata are not in a format that allows for easy analysis within any one survey and the surveys do not have common data formats that would enable analysis of data across surveys . The lack of metadata limits the usefulness of the legacy data from early survey waves . Researchers interested in using the data under current conditions must invest significant time and effort to understand the data structure . This limits the ability of interdisciplinary scientists to analyze data from two or more of the surveys . And finally it limits the availability of the survey results from all three surveys to the broad public that is interested in questions about democracy family well being and social attitudes . This solicitation seeks proposals that will develop tools to bridge data collection and dissemination by first collecting and coding metadata associated with future waves of the ANES GSS and PSID surveys as collection and processing techniques evolve and second migrating or retrofitting metadata associated with earlier i . e . legacy waves of these surveys into formats and schema that are compatible with current and future collection efforts . The goal is to fund projects that will help make the many years of legacy data available to researchers who seek to answer current scientific questions .,"The American National Election Studies ANES General Social Survey GSS and Panel Study of Income Dynamics PSID are long term survey projects that form key research infrastructure for the social and behavioral sciences .

The Big Ideas represent unique opportunities to position our Nation at the cutting edge of global science and engineering leadership by bringing together diverse disciplinary perspectives to support convergence research . As such when responding to this solicitation even though proposals must be submitted to the Office of Integrative Activities once received the proposals will be managed by a cross disciplinary team of NSF Program Directors . Please consult NSF s Large Facilities Manual LFM and its successor to be published as the Major Facilities Guide MFG for definitions of terms used in this solicitation such as the Project Execution Plan . Note that Project Execution Plans should be appropriate for the complexity of the project and may not require all of the elements described in the LFM MFG . NSF supported science and engineering research increasingly relies on cutting edge infrastructure . With its Major Research Instrumentation MRI program and Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC projects NSF supports infrastructure projects at the lower and higher ends of infrastructure scales across science and engineering research disciplines . The Mid scale Research Infrastructure Big Idea is intended to provide NSF with an agile Foundation wide process to fund experimental research capabilities in the mid scale range between the MRI and MREFC thresholds . Within Mid scale RI 1 proposers may submit two types of projects Implementation and Design . Design and Implementation projects may comprise any combination of equipment infrastructure computational hardware and software and necessary commissioning . Design includes planning preliminary and final design of research infrastructure with an anticipated total project cost that is appropriate for future Mid scale RI 1 Mid scale RI 2 or MREFC class investments . Mid scale RI 1 uses an inclusive definition of implementation which can include traditional stand alone construction or acquisition and can include a degree of advanced development leading immediately to final system acquisition and or construction . Mid scale RI 1 Implementation projects may have a total project cost ranging from 6 million up to below 20 million . Projects must directly enable advances in fundamental science engineering or science technology engineering and mathematics STEM education research in one or more of the research domains supported by NSF . Implementation projects may support new or upgraded research infrastructure . Only Mid scale RI 1 Design projects may request less than 6 million with a minimum request of 600 000 and a maximum request below 20 million as needed to prepare for a future mid scale or larger infrastructure implementation project . Successful award of a Mid scale RI 1 design project does not imply NSF commitment to future implementation of that project . Note Mid scale research infrastructure projects beyond the Mid scale RI 1 program limit are anticipated to be separately solicited by a Mid scale RI 2 program . Mid scale RI 1 emphasizes strong scientific merit and response to an identified need of the research community . Demonstrated technical and managerial experience is required for both design and implementation projects as are well developed plans for student training and the involvement of a diverse workforce in all aspects of mid scale activities .,"In 2016 the National Science Foundation NSF unveiled a set of Big Ideas 10 bold long term research and process ideas that identify areas for future investment at the frontiers of science and engineering see https www .

As such when responding to this solicitation even though proposals must be submitted to the Office of Integrative Activities once received the proposals will be managed by a cross disciplinary team of NSF Program Directors . The need for a well defined NSF mid scale funding program has been recognized by stakeholders in the scientific community and by Congress in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act AICA of 2017 . As one of four process ideas in the NSF suite of 10 Big Ideas the Mid scale Research Infrastructure Program is aimed at transforming scientific and engineering research fields as well as science technology engineering and mathematics STEM education research fields by making available new capabilities while simultaneously training early career researchers in the development design and construction of cutting edge infrastructure . The NSF Mid scale Research Infrastructure 2 Program Mid scale RI 2 supports implementation of projects that comprise any combination of equipment instrumentation computational hardware and software and the necessary commissioning and human capital in support of implementation of the same . The total cost for Mid scale RI 2 projects ranges from 20 million to below the minimum award funded by the Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction MREFC Program currently 70 million . Mid scale RI 2 projects will directly enable advances in any of the research domains supported by NSF including STEM education . Projects may also include upgrades to existing research infrastructure . The Mid scale RI 2 Program emphasizes strong scientific merit and response to an identified need of the research community technical and managerial readiness for implementation and a well developed plan for student training and involvement of a diverse workforce in mid scale facility development and or associated data management . Mid scale RI 2 will consider only the implementation typically construction or acquisition stage of a project including a limited degree of advanced development immediately preparatory to implementation . It is thus intended that Mid scale RI 2 will support projects in high states of readiness for implementation i . e . those that have already matured through previous developmental investments . Accordingly Mid scale RI 2 does not support pre implementation early stage design or development . Mid scale RI 2 also does not support post implementation research operations or maintenance the anticipated source s of which are expected to be discussed in the proposal . It is anticipated that solicitations will be issued approximately biennially after the first issuance . Research infrastructure and instrumentation in the range just above the current Major Research Instrumentation Program threshold and below the Mid scale RI 2 threshold is the subject of the Mid scale Research Infrastructure 1 solicitation .,"As one of four process ideas in the NSF suite of 10 Big Ideas the Mid scale Research Infrastructure Program is aimed at transforming scientific and engineering research fields as well as science technology engineering and mathematics STEM education research fields by making available new capabilities while simultaneously training early career researchers in the development design and construction of cutting edge infrastructure .

In this program there is a heavy emphasis on the quality composition and participation of the partners including their appropriate contributions . These partnerships focus on the integration of technologies into a specified human centered service system with the potential to achieve transformational benefits satisfying a real need by making an existing service system smart er or by spurring the creation of an entirely new smart service system . The selected service system should function as a test bed . Service systems are socio technical configurations of people technologies organizations and information 1 designed to create value by fulfilling the needs of those participating in the system . A smart service system is a system that amplifies or augments human capabilities 2 to identify learn adapt monitor and make decisions . The system utilizes data received transmitted or processed in a timely manner thus improving its response to future situations . These capabilities are the result of the incorporation of technologies for sensing actuation coordination communication control etc . PFI BIC funds research partnerships working on projects that operate in the post fundamental translational space the proposers must be mindful of the state of the art and the competitive landscape . However a clear path to commercialization does not need to be a central part of this proposal . These projects require additional effort to integrate the technology into a real service system incorporating human factors considerations to assure the system s efficacy . The research tasks in turn might spawn additional discoveries inspired by this interaction of humans with the technology . Examples of partnership activities that drive sustained innovation include the targeted allocation of resources such as capital time and facilities and sharing of knowledge in a cross organizational and interdisciplinary context . The research tasks of the project must demonstrate a highly collaborative research plan involving participation of the primary industrial partner s as well as of any other primary partners with the academic researcher during the life of the award . NSF recognizes that interdisciplinary collaboration involving many areas of expertise beyond just those related to the technology is needed to achieve successful integration into a smart service system . The research components to be included in this project are 1 engineered system design and integration 2 computing sensing and information technologies and 3 human factors behavioral sciences and cognitive engineering . The proposer must show how these components will be integrated in the context of the project as part of the research plan in the Project Description .

PFI has five broad goals as set forth by the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act of 2017 the Act S . 3084 114th Congress Sec . 602 . Translational Research Grants 1 identifying and supporting NSF sponsored research and technologies that have the potential for accelerated commercialization 2 supporting prior or current NSF sponsored investigators institutions of higher education and non profit organizations that partner with an institution of higher education in undertaking proof of concept work including the development of technology prototypes that are derived from NSF sponsored research and have potential market value 3 promoting sustainable partnerships between NSF funded institutions industry and other organizations within academia and the private sector with the purpose of accelerating the transfer of technology 4 developing multi disciplinary innovation ecosystems which involve and are responsive to the specific needs of academia and industry 5 providing professional development mentoring and advice in entrepreneurship project management and technology and business development to innovators . In addition PFI responds to the mandate set by Congress in Section 601 c 3 of the Act Follow on Grants to support prototype or proof of concept development work by participants including I Corps participants with innovations that because of the early stage of development are not eligible to participate in a Small Business Innovation Research Program or a Small Business Technology Transfer Program . Finally PFI seeks to implement the mandate set by Congress in Section 102 c a of the Act Broader Impacts Review Criterion Update by enhancing partnerships between academia and industry in the United States and expanding the participation of women and individuals from underrepresented groups in innovation technology translation and entrepreneurship . This solicitation offers two broad tracks for proposals in pursuit of the aforementioned goals The Technology Translation PFI TT track offers the opportunity to translate prior NSF funded research results in any field of science or engineering into technological innovations with promising commercial potential and societal impact . PFI TT supports commercial potential demonstration projects for academic research outputs in any NSF funded science and engineering discipline . This demonstration is achieved through proof of concept prototyping technology development and or scale up work . Concurrently students and postdoctoral researchers who participate in PFI TT projects receive education and leadership training in innovation and entrepreneurship . Successful PFI TT projects generate technology driven commercialization outcomes that address societal needs . The Research Partnerships PFI RP track seeks to achieve the same goals as the PFI TT track by supporting instead complex multi faceted technology development projects that are typically beyond the scope of a single researcher or institution and require a multi organizational interdisciplinary synergistic collaboration . A PFI RP project requires the creation of partnerships between academic researchers and third party organizations such as industry non academic research organizations federal laboratories public or non profit technology transfer organizations or other universities . Such partnerships are needed to conduct applied research on a stand alone larger project toward commercialization and societal impact . In the absence of such synergistic partnership the project s likelihood for success would be minimal . The intended outcomes of both PFI TT and PFI RP tracks are a the commercialization of new intellectual property derived from NSF funded research outputs b the creation of new or broader collaborations with industry including increased corporate sponsored research c the licensing of NSF funded research outputs to third party corporations or to start up companies funded by a PFI team and d the training of future innovation and entrepreneurship leaders .

Since the inception of the NPGI and the PGRP there has been a tremendous increase in the availability of functional genomics tools and sequence resources for use in the study of key crop plants and their models . Proposals are welcomed that build on these resources to develop conceptually new and different ideas and strategies to address grand challenge questions in plants of economic importance on a genome wide scale . There is also a critical need for the development of novel and creative tools to facilitate new experimental approaches or new ways of analyzing genomic data . Especially encouraged are proposals that provide strong and novel training opportunities integral to the research plan and particularly across disciplines that include but are not limited to plant physiology quantitative genetics biochemistry bioinformatics and engineering . Activities in four focus areas will be supported in FY 2014 1 Genomics empowered plant research to tackle fundamental questions in plant sciences on a genome wide scale 2 Development of tools and resources for plant genome research including novel technologies and analysis tools to enable discovery 3 Mid Career Investigator Awards in Plant Genome Research MCA PGR to increase participation of investigators trained primarily in fields other than plant genomics and 4 Advancing Basic Research in Economically Important Crop Plants ABR PG to develop sequence resources that are critically needed to enable basic research resources in crop plants . Proposals addressing these opportunities are welcomed at all scales from single investigator projects through multi investigator multi institution projects commensurate with the scope and scale of the work proposed .

The collaborative will be fluid and dynamic utilizing new computer computational science and cyberinfrastructure solutions to address an evolving array of grand challenge questions in plant science . The collaborative will be community driven involving plant biologists computer and information scientists and experts from other disciplines working in integrated teams . The driving force and organizing principles for the collaborative are the grand challenge questions in plant science . The primary means the collaborative will use to pursue these questions are synthesis activities such as working task groups that operate on and off site virtual groups that interact remotely postdoctoral and student fellows visiting scientists and the provision of networking and cyberinfrastructure resources that promote broad interaction and participation . The central resources of the collaborative will be computational and cyberinfrastructure capabilities and expertise that are capable of handling large and heterogeneous plant biology data sets . These resources will be used to craft solutions to an evolving array of grand challenge questions . The collaborative will have a small core of staff members to support the activities of collaborative participants working in real and virtual modes . Resident social scientists will assess how the members of the collaborative community are interacting and using collaborative resources . The structure of the collaborative may be centralized or distributed such as a central hub with several branches . Proposals submitted in response to this solicitation must therefore present a clear description of the capabilities responsibilities and characteristics of the collaborative and a management plan designed to provide strong central leadership .,"The collaborative will be fluid and dynamic utilizing new computer computational science and cyberinfrastructure solutions to address an evolving array of grand challenge questions in plant science .

To this end systems are increasingly being implemented by composing heterogeneous computing components and continually changing memory systems as novel performant hardware surfaces . Applications fueled by rapid strides in machine learning data analysis and extreme scale simulation are becoming more domain specific and highly distributed . In this scenario traditional boundaries between hardware oriented and software oriented disciplines increasingly are blurred . Achieving scalability of systems and applications will therefore require coordinated progress in multiple disciplines such as computer architecture high performance computing HPC programming languages and compilers security and privacy systems theory and algorithms . Cross cutting concerns such as performance including but not limited to time space and communication resource usage and energy efficiency correctness and accuracy including but not limited to emerging techniques for program analysis testing debugging probabilistic reasoning and inference and verification security and privacy robustness and reliability domain specific design and heterogeneity must be taken into account from the outset in all aspects of systems and application design and implementation . The aim of the Principles and Practice of Scalable Systems PPoSS program is to support a community of researchers who will work symbiotically across the multiple disciplines above to perform basic research on scalability of modern applications systems and toolchains . The intent is that these efforts will foster the development of principles that lead to rigorous and reproducible artifacts for the design and implementation of large scale systems and applications across the full hardware software stack . These principles and methodologies should simultaneously provide guarantees on correctness and accuracy robustness and security and privacy of systems applications and toolchains . Importantly as described below PPoSS specifically seeks to fund projects that span the entire hardware software stack and will lay the groundwork for sustainable approaches for engineering highly performant scalable and robust computing applications .,"Cross cutting concerns such as performance including but not limited to time space and communication resource usage and energy efficiency correctness and accuracy including but not limited to emerging techniques for program analysis testing debugging probabilistic reasoning and inference and verification security and privacy robustness and reliability domain specific design and heterogeneity must be taken into account from the outset in all aspects of systems and application design and implementation .

Projects responsive to this solicitation must aim to establish a robust and reproducible set of differentiation design rules predictive models real time sensing control and quality assurance methods and integrate them into a workable differentiation strategy . They must develop a fundamental understanding of how cells develop including mechanisms molecular machinery dynamics and cell cell interactions and use this understanding to manipulate cells purposefully . Investigators can choose any undifferentiated cell type from any animal species as a starting point and choose any appropriate functional product cell organoid etc . with real world relevance . This solicitation parallels NSF s investment in Understanding the Rules of Life URoL Predicting Phenotype NSF s Big Idea focused on predicting the set of observable characteristics phenotype of an organism based on its genetic makeup and the nature of its environment and applies it to understanding and accomplishing the intentional and guided differentiation of an undifferentiated cell into cells organoids or tissues with predetermined activities and functions . The process of differentiation involves a multiplex combination of signaling molecules receptors promoters markers and regulators that dynamically interact to direct cell development and behavior . While individual inducers of native differentiation have been identified and employed to create specialized cell types we still cannot engineer stem cells to allow for synthetic induction of differentiation along a predetermined path that can be actively monitored and manipulated on the fly . Such control of differentiation will enable the realization of individualized medicine in areas such as regenerative medicine cancer treatment with engineered killer cells the development of functional cells and tissues to treat disease environmental control and monitoring adaptive sensing as well as the scalable and reproducible application of 3D organoids in drug testing . The convergence of many disciplines is necessary to answer the fundamental questions and devise the tools needed to realize truly deterministic cell induction and differentiation strategies . As such investigators are encouraged to form interdisciplinary teams with expertise in developmental biology stem cell biology cell biology engineering synthetic and systems biology computation sensing and physics . Proposals will not be responsive to this solicitation if they address only one aspect of the differentiation process or aim to create a functional living product without improving our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie developmental processes . Collaborative proposals of a duration up to 4 years with budgets between 1 000 000 to 1 500 000 total will be considered . Proposed budgets must be justified by project scope and need for complementary expertise . The solicitation will support teams of three or more PI co PIs and senior personnel .

Central to the RIDGE 2000 science plan is the recognition that the origin and evolution of life in deep sea ecosystems are inextricably linked to and perhaps an inevitable consequence of the flow of energy and material from Earth s deep mantle through the volcanic and hydrothermal systems of the oceanic crust to the deep ocean . The complex linkages between life and planetary processes at the mid ocean ridge can be understood only through tightly integrated studies that span a broad range of disciplines in geophysics geology geochemistry biology and oceanography .,,"[""ocean"",""deep"",""life"",""mid""]"

Central to the Ridge 2000 program is the recognition that the origin and evolution of life in deep sea hydrothermal ecosystems are inextricably linked to and perhaps an inevitable consequence of the flow of energy and material from Earth s deep mantle to the seafloor and ocean via magmatic and hydrothermal systems . To sharpen our knowledge of mid ocean ridge systems the first phase of the Ridge 2000 program involved integrated field laboratory and modeling studies of three representative but geographically limited study sites . Research activities spanned a broad range of disciplines from geophysics to geochemistry and from geology to biology to hydrothermal vent fluid dynamics . With this solicitation Ridge 2000 moves into its integration and synthesis phase where results from previous and on going interdisciplinary field expeditions and laboratory studies are to be brought to bear on advancing our conceptual and quantitative understanding of mid ocean ridge systems and the processes that link geological geophysical geochemical hydrothermal and biological processes . As such the program now shifts its focus from field data acquisition to integration and synthesis to help the program achieve its science goals .,With this solicitation Ridge 2000 moves into its integration and synthesis phase where results from previous and on going interdisciplinary field expeditions and laboratory studies are to be brought to bear on advancing our conceptual and quantitative understanding of mid ocean ridge systems and the processes that link geological geophysical geochemical hydrothermal and biological processes .,"[""field"",""hydrothermal"",""idge"",""program"",""ocean""]"

Integration will need to be across material sets 0D 1D 2D 3D hierarchical nanoparticles etc . across length scales molecular to nano to micro to meso to macro and across function mechanical electrical optical chemical biological thermal etc . and across processes top down bottom up . Integration will involve the study and implementation of hybrid manufacturing and assembly processes and methods . The research will be driven by the need to understand and establish among others design rules for integrated systems manufacturing and integration process and control models and measurement science and technology . The desired outcome will be a nano enabled integrated system that combines many different functions together to work as one entity and that is made up of component subsystems that are designed to perform in a unified manner .

This may include environmentally benign approaches and life cycle considerations . These elements should be carefully explained and justified in proposals since both the scientific novelty and the feasibility of the methods being researched will be important evaluation factors . The SNM IS solicitation is NOT seeking research proposals in large scale manufacturing of single component nanomaterials and nanostructures . Novel ideas in novel nanomanufacturing processes and scale up may be sent to the core Nanomanufacturing NM Program . Competitive proposals are expected to address the training and education of students in nanomanufacturing system integration and related areas .

Design is a topic of great interest in many fields the goal of the SoD Program is to advance design research and education to meet the critical software design challenges of the 21st century . The objective of the program is to bring new paradigms concepts approaches models and theories into the development of a strong intellectual foundation for software design which will ultimately improve the processes of constructing evaluating and modifying software intensive systems . This body of knowledge needs to be intellectually rigorous formalized where appropriate supported by empirical evidence where possible open to creative artistic expression and above all teachable . Future software intensive systems will be vastly different from those in use today . Revolutionary advances in hardware networking and human interface technologies will require entirely new ways of thinking about how software systems are conceptualized built understood and evaluated . As we envision the future of complex distributed computing environments innovative research is needed to provide the scientific foundations for managing issues of complexity quality cost and human intellectual control of software design and development . To these ends importing and adapting ideas from other design fields engineering biology architecture economics and the arts for example are encouraged . Similarly it is critical that software design researchers work across different areas within computer science to insure that design includes the interdependencies of software with other systems artifacts such as complex data structures and data repositories . Thus continuations of current lines of research or research to incrementally extend current software design methods are unlikely to be competitive in this solicitation . While proposals from individual researchers will be considered by the SoD program this year the program s focus will be on interdisciplinary team projects . Each proposal should provide a convincing argument that the proposed research is innovative and unique in its contribution to the Science of Design discipline including careful reference to the literature .

Roosevelt stated A nation that destroys its soils destroys itself . This statement remains true to this day . Soil forms over thousands of years and can be destroyed in a single event . It is a natural asset alongside water and air but is often overlooked despite being the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems that support food production economic prosperity and services that are essential for humanity . Soils are complex living ecosystems containing billions of organisms that mediate a myriad of biological chemical and physical processes interacting to cycle carbon and nutrients essential for plant growth food and fiber production and to remove contaminants from water . Soil is also the foundation material for all structures not supported on rock and by orders of magnitude is the most widely used construction material in the world . Soil ecosystems supply most of the antibiotics used to fight human diseases control the movement of water and chemical substances between the Earth and atmosphere and act as source and storage media for gases important to life such as oxygen carbon dioxide and methane . Thus as the Earth s population grows we need a better understanding of soil ecosystems that will continue to play a critical role in feeding the world .

To accomplish this research multiple disciplines must converge to produce novel sensors and or sensing systems of multiple modalities that are adaptable to different environments and collect data and report on a wide range of chemical biological and physical parameters . This type of approach will also be necessary to develop next generation soil models wireless communication and cyber systems capabilities and to grow a scientific community that is able to address complex problems through education and outreach .

Roosevelt stated A nation that destroys its soils destroys itself . This statement remains true to this day . Soils form over hundreds of years and yet can be destroyed in a single event . They are an often overlooked natural asset despite being the foundation of terrestrial ecosystems that support food production economic prosperity and many other services that are essential for humanity . Soils are complex ecosystems composed of organic matter minerals water air and billions of organisms . Such ecosystems interact with the flora and fauna they support to mediate myriad biological chemical and physical processes essential for plant growth food and fiber production and contaminant removal . Soils are also the foundation material for all structures not supported on rock and by orders of magnitude are the most widely used construction material in the world . Soils are the source of most of the antibiotics used to fight human diseases control the movement of water and chemical substances between the Earth and atmosphere and act as source and storage media for gases such as oxygen carbon dioxide and methane . As a result of their essential importance soils are also part of our cultural heritage . Thus as the Earth s population grows we need a better understanding of soil ecosystems that will continue to play a critical role in supporting societies around the world . The National Science Foundation NSF Directorates for Engineering ENG and Geosciences GEO the Divisions of Integrative Organismal Systems IOS and Environmental Biology DEB in the Directorate for Biological Sciences BIO the Division of Computer and Network Systems in the Directorate Computer and Information Science and Engineering CISE CNS and the Division of Chemistry CHE in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences in collaboration with the US Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture USDA NIFA encourage convergent research that transforms existing capabilities in understanding dynamic soil processes including soil formation through advances in sensor systems and modeling . The Signals in the Soil SitS program fosters collaboration among the two partner agencies and the researchers they support by combining resources and funding for the most innovative and high impact projects that address their respective missions . To make transformative advances in our understanding of soils multiple disciplines must converge to produce environmentally benign novel sensing systems with multiple modalities that can adapt to different environments and collect and transmit data for a wide range of biological chemical and physical parameters . Effective integration of sensor data will be key for achieving a better understanding of signaling interactions among plants animals microbes the soil matrix and aqueous and gaseous components . New sensor networks have the potential to inform models in novel ways to radically change how data is obtained from various natural and managed both urban and rural ecosystems and to better inform the communities that directly rely on soils for sustenance and livelihood .,"Such ecosystems interact with the flora and fauna they support to mediate myriad biological chemical and physical processes essential for plant growth food and fiber production and contaminant removal .

Synopsis of Program The STTR program is Congressionally mandated and intended to support scientific excellence and technological innovation through the investment of federal research funds to build a strong national economy by stimulating technological innovation in the private sector strengthening the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs increasing the commercial application of federally supported research results and fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women owned small businesses . The STTR program at NSF solicits proposals from the small business sector consistent with NSF s mission to promote the progress of science to advance the national health prosperity and welfare and to secure the national defense . The program is governed by Public Law 112 81 SBIR STTR Reauthorization Act of 2011 and was reauthorized by Public Law 114 328 . STTR policy is provided by the Small Business Administration SBA through the STTR Policy Directive . A main purpose of the legislation is to stimulate technological innovation and increase private sector commercialization . The NSF SBIR STTR program is therefore in a unique position to meet both the goals of NSF and the purpose of the SBIR STTR legislation by transforming scientific discovery and innovation into both social and economic benefit and by emphasizing private sector commercialization . Because the program has no topical or procurement focus the NSF offers very broad solicitation topics that are intended to permit as many eligible science and technology based small businesses as possible to compete for funding . The topics are detailed on the website . In many cases the program is also open to proposals focusing on technical and market areas not explicitly noted in the aforementioned topics .,"Unlike fundamental research the NSF STTR program supports startups and small businesses in the creation of innovative disruptive technologies getting discoveries out of the lab and into the market .

Most current IPS operate in pre programmed ways and in a limited variety of contexts . They are largely incapable of handling novel situations or of even understanding when they are outside their areas of expertise . To achieve robust long term autonomy however future IPS need to be aware of their capabilities and limitations and to adapt their behaviors to compensate for limitations and or changing conditions . To foster such intelligent systems the S AS program supports research in four main aspects of IPS cognizant taskable adaptive and ethical . Cognizant IPS exhibit high level awareness of their own capabilities and limitations anticipating potential failures and re planning accordingly . Taskable IPS can interpret high level possibly vague instructions planning out and executing concrete actions that are dependent on the particular context in which the system is operating . Adaptive IPS can change their behaviors over time learning from their own experiences and those of other entities such as other IPS or humans and from instruction or observation . Ethical IPS should adhere to a system of societal and legal rules taking those rules into account when making decisions .

Through this solicitation MCB and NSF hope to develop a novel mechanism that will encourage investigators to expand and or transition to new research areas aligned with MCB priorities to increase retention of investigators in science and to ensure a diverse scientific workforce that remains engaged in active research . Highest funding priority is given to proposals that have outstanding intellectual merit and broader impacts while proposals with weaknesses in either category or those that are perceived as likely to have an incremental impact will not be competitive . Proposals should also demonstrate a strong record of prior accomplishment a compelling plan for professional development that will enable the PI to forge a new direction in their scholarship and a strong rationale for why this support is needed for the PI to become competitive in the new research area . Support for the proposed transition from the PI s department described in a letter from the department chair or equivalent will also be required . Proposals that do not describe a plan for a transition in research direction will be considered unresponsive . Proposals that are motivated to understand the molecular and cellular basis of disease and disease treatments are not appropriate for the Division and will be returned without review . Proposals addressing major open questions at the intersections of biology with other disciplines such as physics chemistry mathematics computer sciences and engineering are of particular interest to the program .,"The Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences MCB has developed a new opportunity to enable researchers with a strong track record of prior accomplishment to pursue a new avenue of research or inquiry .

The Understanding the Rules of Life Microbiome Theory and Mechanisms URoL MTM program is an integrative collaboration across Directorates and Offices within the National Science Foundation . The objective of URoL MTM is to understand and establish the theory and mechanisms that govern the structure and function of microbiomes a collection of microbes in a specific habitat environment . This may include but is not limited to host associated microbiomes such as those with humans and other organisms where i the microbiome impacts host physiology behavior development and fitness ii the host influences the metabolic activity dynamics and evolution of the microbiome and iii the environment biological chemical physical and social influences and is influenced by both the host and the microbiome . Recent progress has transformed our ability to identify and catalogue the microbes present in a given environment and measure multiple aspects of biological chemical physical and social environments that affect the interactions among the members of the microbiome the host and or habitat . Much descriptive and correlative work has been performed on many microbiome systems particularly those in the human soil aquatic and built environments . This research has resulted in new hypotheses about the microbiome s contributions to potential system function or dysfunction . The current challenge is to integrate the wide range of accumulated data and information and build on them to develop new causal mechanistic models or theories of interactions and interdependencies across scales and systems . Elucidating these relationships informs our understanding of the Rules of Life the theoretical constructs and models that explain and predict the characteristics of living systems spanning from molecular and sub cellular components to cells whole organisms communities and biomes . The URoL MTM program invites integrated interdisciplinary proposals that develop theoretical predictive frameworks with well designed experimental and or computational approaches to generate and test hypotheses about the causal relationships within the microbiome and among the microbiome host and environment . How these relationships affect robustness resilience and adaptability of individual organisms populations and communities are also of interest . Projects may apply existing ecological and evolutionary theory or develop new experimental computational or mathematical tools models and theory to i explain function and interactions in natural experimental and model microbiomes ii elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie communication between the host and the microbiome and among the members of the microbiome and or iii comparatively analyze microbiomes to discover emergent properties that provide insight into the behavior of living systems . Successful projects will contribute to a portfolio of research that identifies general principles rules that underlie a wide spectrum of biological phenomena across spatial temporal from sub second to geologic and or complexity molecular cellular organismal population scales . URoL MTM projects must integrate perspectives and research approaches from more than one research discipline e . g . biology chemistry computer science engineering geosciences mathematics physics social and behavioral sciences .
