S . , University of Wisconsin Milwaukee , 1972B . S . , St . Ambrose University , 1970My research group focuses on heterogeneous catalysis , ranging from rational catalyst design and synthesis to characterization and evaluation . Current interests are in the design and synthesis of novel bimetallic catalysts for the selective transformation of hydrocarbons to higher value chemicals and for higher output PEM fuel cells . Bimetallic catalysts afford great opportunities for changing performance , either by changing the catalyst surfaces into ensembles of catalytic sites that permit only selected reaction pathways , modifying the electronic properties of the catalytic surface sites , or by introducing bifunctionality to the active surface by placing different catalytic metals in contiguous proximity . Bimetallic catalyst synthesis is often carried out by either simultaneous co impregnation of both metal salts onto the catalyst support or by successive steps of metal salt addition . For either of these preparative methods , it is virtually impossible to ensure formation of only bimetallic particles rather , formation of separate metallic particles of both metals can and does occur . Thus , it is very difficult to characterize such catalytic systems , and even more difficult to correlate catalyst performance with bimetallic catalyst composition . Our laboratory uses electroless deposition ED , whereby a controlled chemical reaction is used to deposit a metal salt onto a catalytic metal site that has been activated by a reducing agent . The process may be either catalytic deposition of the metal salt metal A from solution onto the pre existing metal metal B on the support or autocatalytic deposition of the metal salt metal A onto the just reduced , deposited metal metal A , depending on the nature of the activated metal site and the reducing agent . In principle , ED should result in the selective deposition of the secondary metal onto a metallic surface with no formation of isolated crystallites of the secondary metal on the catalyst support . Perhaps most importantly , ED is an industrially relevant process that can be applied to a wide range of metals . We have prepared a large number of bimetallic catalysts using electroless deposition . Those supported on carbon , such as Pt Co , Pt Pd , and Pt Rh have been tested as electrocatalysts for PEM fuel cells , while silica supported compositions such as Ag Pt , Au Pd , and Cu Pd have been evaluated for traditional catalytic reactions such as selective epoxidation of olefins , selective oxidation of biomass molecules such as glycerol , and selective hydrogenation of multi functional olefins . Reactions are conducted in either automated , single pass plug flow reactors six in all or two high pressure batch or stirred tank reactors .

Furthermore , we seek to determine how various A aggregation products affect both neuronal and vascular cells .

Catalysis carried out in the liquid phase is very important for applications such as fine chemicals and pharmaceutical production , and in the production of new fuels from biorenewable resources . Our primary research involves the development and application of in situ or operando surface vibrational spectroscopic methods to study adsorption and catalysis at solid catalyst surfaces under industrially relevant reaction conditions i . e . , in the liquid phase and or at high gas pressures and temperatures . Specific techniques under development in our group include surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS , attenuated total reflection infrared ATR IR spectroscopy , and sum frequency spectroscopy SFS . The information obtained with these approaches allows us to develop a molecular level understanding of the catalytic mechanisms that govern the function of heterogeneous catalysts under reaction conditions . Such understanding is critical if we wish to rationally design catalysts for specific applications in the future . Current reaction systems of interest include enantioselective hydrogenation of alpha ketoesters and alkenoic acids selective oxidation of alcohols , including especially glycerol , which is the major byproduct in biodiesel production hydrodeoxygenation of biomass derived organic acids and acid esters to hydrocarbon fuel and electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons . Catalysts under investigation involve both polycrystalline transition metals and oxide supported mono and bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts . The latter materials are prepared either through traditional catalyst synthesis methods or more novel protocols under development e . g . , dendrimer metal nano composites , electroless deposition that allow for control of size and composition on the nanoscale .
